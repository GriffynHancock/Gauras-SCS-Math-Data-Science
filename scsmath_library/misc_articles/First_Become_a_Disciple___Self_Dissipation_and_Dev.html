        <span class="txt_body_ital">Ref: Sri Guru and His Grace &quot;What ever 
        happened to the conception of 'one diksha guru and many siksha gurus', 
        vande gurun? Wasn't this your propaganda in the 1980's? Now the Math is 
        making propaganda that makes ISKCON sectarianism look like a broad-minded 
        approach. How is this?&quot; [A response to the post, &quot;<a href="040411_OneMasterDog.html">One 
        Master Dog.</a>&quot;]</span><br>
        <br>
        We should resist the rote recitation of formula as if it were profound 
        revelation. Partially digested concepts are regurgitated by the faithful 
        to enlighten others. Yesterday's shallow epiphany loses vitality and is 
        vomited as cant. &quot;One <i>diksha guru</i> and many <i>siksha gurus</i>&quot; 
        is not a slogan for a bumper sticker. Its profundity vanishes in indiscriminate 
        application. Conceptually, without depth perception, collision is inevitable; 
        the superficial vision of a neophyte collides with the higher. If we do 
        not properly conceive of guru then analytical classifications of guru 
        are irrelevant misnomers.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;<i>Vande gurun</i>&quot; is not siddhantic prodding to remove sectarian 
        blinders and embrace all things that flood the field of one's vision as 
        divine. It is recognition of the principle of guru in diverse maifestation 
        and tacitly those who personify a certain degree of excellence. Uncritical 
        comparisons are odious. When Mahaprabhu heard Srivas comparing Advaita 
        to Prahlad and Suka he was enraged. Indiscriminate acceptance is the confused 
        companion of exclusionary fanaticism. Contrary to a popular misperception 
        we were never promoting <i>siksha gurus</i> as the vogue. Our approach 
        to Srila Sridhar Maharaja was cautious, measured and under the guidance 
        and order of Srila Swami Maharaja Prabhupada (&quot;the discerning eye 
        of an expert&quot;). He recognized, revealed and recommended Srila Sridhar 
        Maharaja as his <i>siksha guru</i>.<br>
        <br>
        Incidentally, his ISKCON is indisputably the most successful recruiting 
        organization for the worldwide Krishna consciousness. All other missions 
        have benefited by an influx of ISKCON members and are for the most part 
        lead by former ISKCON members. To dismiss the efforts of ISKCON is to 
        ignore heaps of reality. It is disingenuous, and an act of denial and 
        ingratitude.<br>
        <br>
        If we are unable to discern the difference between being dense and being 
        dedicated, we will misread substance; reject the real and embrace the 
        false. Mahaprabhu himself tried unsuccessfully to convert Murari Gupta 
        to His Krishna conception. When he wouldn't budge, He could have accused 
        him of sectarian fanaticism; being entrenched in a lower conception. Rather 
        He placed his devotion on a pedestal for all to bow before as the standard: 
        a &quot;one master dog.&quot; Mahaprabhu happily signed off on his forehead, 
        &quot;Ramdas.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The gist of Sri Guru and His Grace lies in the capacity to recognize that 
        highest substance whenever and wherever it appears and in diverse manifestation. 
        But that is proportionate to one's qualification (<i>adhikara</i>). If 
        one lacks the capacity and qualification to recognize substance, a &quot;plurality&quot; 
        theme becomes suspect. Case in point: blatant sahajiyaism under the auspices 
        of Srila Saraswati Thakur and Gaudiya Math and commercial marketing of 
        spiritual concepts. The conception of a plurality of gurus has been misappropriated, 
        adulterated, and perverted to the point of corruption. It fuels the guru 
        trade as a lure for the na&iuml;ve and inexperienced. The present landscape 
        is bombarded by a bazaar of barkers, &quot;C'mon, <i>ma&ntilde;jari swarup</i>; 
        best quality &#151; cheap price!&quot; <br>
        <br>
        Srila Govinda Maharaja once chided me for being indirectly responsible 
        for the widespread abuse of the concepts revealed in Sri Guru and His 
        Grace, &quot;You should have included a chapter called &quot;First Become 
        a Disciple.&quot; He quoted the Katha Upanishad's observing that as rare 
        as it is to find a qualified guru in this world, it is equally rare, even 
        more miraculous, to find a qualified disciple (<i>ascaryo j&ntilde;ata 
        kusalanusistah</i>). If we do not properly conceive of guru and what it 
        means to offer ourselves in service to guru (disciple), extending that 
        to include a plurality merely amplifies misconception. <br>
        <br>
        <b>diksha-kale bhakta kare atma-samarpana</b><br>
        <br>
        At the time of initiation one offers oneself to the guru. Without self-giving, 
        initiation is mere formality. Arjuna offers himself as a disciple, surrenders 
        his autonomy and transfers judgment to Krishna. Accepting a guru is not 
        an adornment but a life altering decision. The Western approach, to acquire 
        knowledge that will serve one, is antithetical to the Eastern approach 
        of offering oneself in the service of higher knowledge. We must examine 
        our motives. Are we trying to make Divinity an object of our experience 
        or offer ourselves as instruments for the flow of Divine will? As a perfect 
        disciple Arjuna offers himself to be predominated by the will of Krishna. 
        Admiring someone, who successfully offered his life in service, Srila 
        Govinda Maharaja mused, &quot;Saraswati Thakur's desire played over him 
        very smoothly (<i>vilasatu hrdi nityam bhaktisiddhanta-vani</i>).&quot;<br>
        <br>
        It is by misjudgment (error in selection) that we find ourselves in the 
        present predicament. We must admit that our estimation of the world before 
        us, and our place in it, is an endless source of confusion and frustration. 
        Afflicted and miserable the finite approaches the Infinite and invites 
        help. The Absolute descends within relative circumstance and guides the 
        soul toward self-fulfillment through dedication. By submitting to his 
        agent she gradually rises out of the plane of misconception (<i>anartha</i>). 
        She re-conceives herself as a unit of dedication (not exploitation) and 
        seeks fulfillment through a life of devotion. Reality broadcasts itself 
        into this plane via the medium of guru. The aspiring devotee must be surcharged 
        with a serving current to be a fit receiver (<i>sevonmukhata</i>). Through 
        self-dissipation the soul is transformed. The essence of sandalwood is 
        expressed when it is pressed against a grindstone; its fragrance released. 
        This is self-expression in its truest sense. By divine inspiration we 
        are compelled to move against the current of the world toward the plane 
        of dedication (<i>prachodayat</i>). The result is ego dissolution and 
        the release of inner serving potential by which the soul overcomes the 
        influence of karmic gravity.<br>
        <br>
        As jarring as it is to the modern ear, Srila Sridhar Maharaja preferred 
        the term, &quot;slave&quot; to convey the import of Krishna Das (Radha 
        Dasi). It underscores the depth of servitude. &quot;We are slaves of the 
        truth&#133;. I shall offer myself as a slave&#133;&quot; etc. What kind 
        of faith is required to offer oneself as a slave? And to whom? Goaded 
        by humanists to achieve autonomy, any concept of slavery appears anathema 
        to the educated, Western mind.<br>
        <br>
        The persistent lure for the intelligent is the prospect of achieving autonomy 
        by distilling the relativistic mean of a cacophony of humanistic voices. 
        Modern thinkers tell us smugly that literature will &quot;replace religion 
        and philosophy&quot; as people opt for &quot;adventures of the intelligence&quot; 
        to guide them. Factor in depreciation and read as: literature/movies/TV/internet/Gameboy.<br>
        <br>
        Pragmatists dismiss Divine revelation as unverifiable, &quot;nonhuman,&quot; 
        irrelevant. They do not object to being under someone's influence, or 
        imbibing the opinion of others, but it must be &quot;whose opinion matters.&quot; 
        Since we cannot verify divine revelation we should limit our concerns 
        with the human. Spiritual life begins with the antithesis: belief in the 
        possibility of divine revelation. Conceding that the finite cannot know 
        the Infinite by finite means, but not dismissing the possibility that 
        the Infinite can make itself known to the finite by Infinite means (revelation).<br>
        <br>
        Bhaktivinode Thakur redirects our focus toward &quot;revealed truth.&quot; 
        Dismiss the opinions of the mass. The mass is ass. Their combined braying 
        &#151; pluralistic democracy &#151; is merely the depreciating mean of 
        misconception. In the language of Srila Sridhar Maharaja, &quot;The sum 
        total of the finite will never equal the Infinite.&quot; Divine revelation 
        descends into this world via the agency of guru, we must attune ourselves 
        and dance with that. Projecting the imaginative, adulterated aspirations 
        of the lower upon the higher and declaring it &quot;Divine&quot; is delusion. 
        To force our will upon the higher is self-deception; to mask the mundane 
        as spiritual. In Bengal they joke of a &quot;bogus Radharani.&quot; She 
        is making a garland of <i>bak phul</i>, a flower that can also be cooked. 
        When someone asks, &quot;Radharani, why are you stringing <i>bak phul</i>?&quot; 
        She says movingly, &quot;If Krishna comes, I will offer him a garland&quot; 
        then happily, &quot;and if he doesn't come, I'll cook a subji!&quot; <br>
        <br>
        So before we discuss &quot;many&quot; let's be candid and examine our 
        motives. Are we even willing to offer ourselves fully to one? Are we prepared 
        for the total transfer of judgment to be given over to another and to 
        take their instruction (<i>siksha</i>) as all in all? Without substantially 
        offering ourselves, the transaction is superficial. It is through self-dissipation 
        and self-forgetfulness that the finite captures the Infinite (<i>sri krsna 
        karsini ca sa</i>). The finite will sacrifice itself in service to Sri 
        Guru and draw the Infinite in exchange. This is the highest aspiration 
        and noblest struggle ever taken up by anyone; what price, what sacrifice 
        should we be prepared for? The famous Bengali freedom fighter Netaji Subhas 
        Chandra Bose used to challenge his countrymen, &quot;Give me your blood 
        and I'll give you freedom!&quot; Srila Govinda Maharaja summarizes the 
        tenor of Srila Guru Maharaja's call, &quot;Give me your blood and I'll 
        give you devotion.&quot;<br>
