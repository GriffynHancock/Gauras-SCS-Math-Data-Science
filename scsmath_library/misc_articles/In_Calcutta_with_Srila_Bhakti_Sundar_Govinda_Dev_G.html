<p>ALL GLORIES TO SRI SRI GURU GAURANGA!!<br>
          July 2, 2005</p>
        <p>Dear bhaktas,</p>

          and Hare Krishna. Because the devotees are compared to honeybees who 
          are always collecting nectar to make honey, and because, I know, they 
          feel great separation from His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Sundar Govinda 
          Dev-Goswami Maharaj, I wanted to share a summary of Srila Govinda Maharaj's 
          divine comments from the last three mornings. I am visiting with His 
          Divine Grace from June 29 and plan to return to the US on July 22. During 
          this time, if you will not take offense at my feeble attempts to summarize 
          the instructions of Srila Govinda Maharaj for the devotee community, 
          I would be glad to share with you, and also for my own benefit, His 
          Divine Grace's words of encouragement. I am helped also by His Grace 
          Bhakti Sudhir Goswami Maharaj who is a vast resource of the teachings 
          of Srila Guru Maharaj.<br>

        <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj begins: The service of the Vaishnava is the highest. 
          That is described in the 5th Canto, 7th Canto and 11th Canto of the 
          <i>Srimad Bhagavatam.</i> But, to be a &quot;louse&quot; in the hair 
          of Guru, that is not service. We need to apply ourselves to hear and 
          chant the Vaishnava books and teachings given to us. We may have some 
          doubts about the &quot;conscious world&quot;, but our experience as 
          devotees will tell us differently (i.e. remove any doubts). </p>
        <p>We are so fortunate. So many lifetimes we have passed... now in this 
          lifetime we have gotten this opportunity by the grace of Gurudeva to 
          become Krishna conscious. We must have sadhu-sanga, it does not matter 
          sannyas or grihastha association. So many of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's 
          associates were grihasthas (householders). Only a few, like Swarup Damodar, 
          were sannyasis. Nityananda Prabhu was an avadhut, and Sri Chaitanya 
          Mahaprabhu was a sannyasi, but most of His associates were grihasthas. 
          Srila Govinda Maharaj was saying that we need good association, whether 
          by sannyas or with grihastha, it doesn't matter. Sri Krishna Chaitanya, 
          Prabhu Nityananda, Sri Advaita, Gadadhar, Srivasadi Gaura Bhakta Vrinda.</p>
        <p>Bhaktivinoda Thakur gave his <i>Amrita Pravaha Bhasya</i> commentary 
          on the <i>Chaitanya Charitamrita</i>..., then Srila Bhaktisiddhanta 
          Saraswati Thakur Prabhupad yet still gave his nectarean commentary. 
          There is no end to the glory of Krishna, just as Ananta Deva with so 
          many heads and tongues cannot find an end to the glorification.</p>
        <p>Several bhaktas visiting from Australia were going on to Puri for Rathayatra 
          on July 8th. Maharaj said that the pandas have the tradition of keeping 
          non-hindus out of the temple. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not break 
          that tradition. But Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu chose Haridas Thakur, a 
          muslim born, as His own Namacharya. It was even more difficult in those 
          times than it is today. Many of the devotees are pathan-vaishnavas, 
          have some muslim background. They have no caste pride. But, still, at 
          Rathayatra, Jagannath Himself comes out to have darshan of all His faithful 
          and to give darshan to all His faithful. </p>
        <p>This is just one brahmanda (universe) and they are innumerable. Maharaj 
          noted that there are fourteen planetary systems, seven higher and seven 
          lower, and beyond that Viraja, and then Brahmaloka (Brahman) and beyond 
          that Vaikuntha. Quoting <i>Sri Brahma Samhita:</i> Verse 40, yasya prabha.... 
          Brahman is only the bodily effulgence of Krishna, and Krishna is the 
          highest Truth, Krishnas tu Bhagavan swayam. </p>
        <p>Everyone in Vrindaban in the time of Srila Krishna das Kaviraj appreciated 
          his realization of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's lila. They encouraged 
          him to write about Mahaprabhu's lila and teachings. Srila Kaviraj was 
          humble and reluctant, as well as old and with failing eyesight. He went 
          to Sri Sri Radha-Madan-Mohan Temple, and asked Their permission. The 
          garland fell from Sri Madan-Mohan and Srila Kaviraj received that garland 
          from the pujari.<br>

        <p>Prabodhananda Saraswati was in the Ramanuja Sampradaya. He is the author 
          of <i>Sri Chaitanya Chandra-amrita</i> and <i>Radha Rasa Sudhanidhi.</i> 
          He is very much qualified in expressing the lila of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 
          himself. His identity is said to be that of one of the eight principle 
          sakhis, Tunga Vidya. He was the uncle of Gopal Bhatta Goswami. When 
          Krishna das Kaviraj approached him for blessings and permission to write 
          on the pastimes of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Prabodhananda Saraswati 
          gave him permission to do so but on one condition: that Srila Krishna 
          das Kaviraj not mention him (Prabodhananda Saraswati) in his work. Srila 
          Govinda Maharaj expressed that the reason for this was explained by 
          Srila Guru Maharaj. Prabodhananda Saraswati knew that Sri Chaitanya 
          Mahaprabhu was promoting the Rupanuga Sampradaya. Therefore, Prabodhananada 
          Saraswati did not want himself mentioned in the <i>Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita</i> 
          to distract from the Will of Mahaprabhu. </p>
        <p>Also, it should be noted that when taking the name of Prabodhananda, 
          it must be taken as Prabodhananda Saraswati. Some individuals falsely 
          claim that Prabodhananda Saraswati was a mayavad converted by Lord Chaitanyadeva. 
          This is not possible for an asta-sakhi.<br>

      <p>Krishna is so kind to give us shelter at His Lotus Feet. Bahunam janmanam 
        ante(BG), many lifetimes we have passed to get this opportunity. One bhakta 
        wrote asking the question whether he should preach because he does not 
        feel that he has perfect knowledge. Srila Govinda Maharaj thought about 
        this last night and again this morning, expressing finally the following. 
        Only one person has perfect knowledge as far as I know and that is my 
        Guru Maharaj. But, I may have $5, it is still currency. </p>
      <p>yare dekha tare kaha krishna upadesa. On the order and for the pleasure 
        of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, we must try to preach Krishna consciousness 
        to others. <i>(CC Madhya 7.128).</i></p>
      <p>It is true that it is very rare to find someone in this world who knows 
        &quot;everything.&quot; Srila Govinda Maharaj quotes <i>Sri Brahma Samhita</i> 
        verse 56: sriyah kantah... vidantas te santah ksiti virala charah katipaye. 
        &quot;Practically no one in this world knows that place but for a few 
        pure devotees, and they know it as Goloka.&quot; Even our Srila Guru Maharaj 
        said that we are practitioners, students. Always have the mentality of 
        a student. Even if one is placed in the position of Guru, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta 
        Saraswati Thakur identified himself like a monitor in a class. </p>
      <p>Quoting Srila Guru Maharaj's <i>&quot;Bhaktivinoda Viraha Dasakam&quot;</i> 
        found in <i>Sri Sri Prapanna Jivanamritam,</i> Srimati Radharani's Lotus 
        Feet cannot be given by anyone except for Her associates. We must not 
        be hopeless. </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj recollects how there were many great disciples 
        of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. They would come to visit Srila 
        Guru Maharaj, and thus Srila Govinda Maharaj met and received the blessings 
        of all of them. He could only recall one disciple, Srila Bhakti Pradip 
        Tirtha Maharaj of Puri, that he had not had the opportunity to meet. They 
        were all coming to have Srila Guru Maharaj's association and instruction.</p>
      <p>Please forgive any offense in presenting this to you for your devotional 
        upliftment. In general, Srila Govinda Maharaj is in stable health. He 
        feels the need at this time to remain in Calcutta for health reasons, 
        however, and as of the moment, His Divine Grace is not planning to attend 
        the Rathayatra Celebration in Puri. About 100 devotees will be going however 
        by bus, train and plane. Hare Krishna.</p>

      <p>This morning Srila Govinda Maharaj honestly and spontaneously praised 
        the seva of the Italian devotees who cooperate so beautifully and without 
        false ego together for the satisfaction of Sri Sri Guru Gauranga. He is 
        very, very satisfied with their offerings of service. </p>
      <p>He is always amazed at the service of Srimati Krishna Kanta dd whose 
        transcendental vision bypasses the infirmity of her own body for the service 
        of Sri Sri Nitai-Gauranga. What a wonderful example for any and all, and 
        it is genuinely kept in the heart of Srila Govinda Maharaj, giving him 
        strength also. </p>
      <p>This morning Sripad Yudhamanyu Prabhu, Jivana dd, and Urmila dd (one 
        of Srila Govinda Maharaj's new young Chinese disciples) arrived with much 
        mutual affection in Calcutta. Urmila dd is the artist who saw a photo 
        of the Deities from Soquel and proceded to paint Sri Sri Radha Krishna 
        and Sriman Mahaprabhu. Her parents sent beautiful and humble gifts for 
        Srila Govinda Maharaj. </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj received the pilgrims with much honor and affection. 
        He spoke for a few moments how Lord Buddha was born in India but he introduced 
        Buddhism throughout Asia and China. Then His Grace emphasized that the 
        Vedas, Puranas, Itihasas (histories), Upanishads, all declare that life 
        will go on after death, after liberation. He has restated a theme which 
        His Divine Grace uses almost daily when he speaks. &quot;We are all so 
        very fortunate to have Krishna consciousness in this lifetime.&quot; </p>
      <p>He also received many offerings of seva which Jivana dd brought from 
        Soquel. He opened and acknowledged each and every one of them. He praised 
        Kumkum dd, and Divya Shakti dd, as well as Jivana dd and so many others. 
        He dreamed that he would like to return to stay in Soquel, but he knows 
        that for his health he is remaining in Calcutta. </p>

      <p>This morning I awoke just after 2 am and chanted japa. Srila Govinda 
        Maharaj arose at 3 am. After finishing some japa, I continued my reading 
        of a translation of the Sri Chaitanya Bhagavat by Srila Vrindaban das 
        Thakur. I remarked to Srila Govinda Maharaj that I did not understand 
        what was meant by Nityananda Prabhu being called an Avadhut until I entered 
        into this great literature. </p>
      <p>The beautiful heart of Srila Govinda Maharaj opened up. He quoted a verse 
        which Srila Guru Maharaj heard from a respected bhakta in Mednapur District. 
        The bhakta's name was Viraja and he was part of the Nanda Family. The 
        quote is from the Vaishnava Tantra describing the nature of an Avadhut. 
        I checked the Sanskrit with Srila Govinda Maharaj and, lacking ability 
        to show diacriticals on this email, I will do my best to write it out 
        for those interested.</p>
      <p>Wherever there is a long &quot;a&quot; will be represented by two a's 
        side by side, and a long &quot;i&quot; by two i's side by side:</p>

      <p>You might not find this sloka in any standard texts so make note of it 
        if you find it interesting.</p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj then recalled how (from Sri Chaitanya Bhagavat) 
        Lord Chaitanyadeva requested the kaupin (loincloth) of Sri Nityananda 
        Prabhu and Mahaprabhu tore it into strips of cloth and distributed this 
        to His associates describing it as most worshipable. The devotees tied 
        it around their foreheads. </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj began spontaneously singing verses from the Sri 
        Chaitanya Charitamrita and then 'Nitai Pada Kamala...' with great feeling 
        as His Divine Grace's beautiful transcendental mood melted my heart. It 
        is frankly difficult for Srila Govinda Maharaj to sing as he once did 
        because of spasms of coughing that occur. </p>
      <p>Then Srila Govinda Maharaj noted that if you see Lord Nityananda with 
        a bottle of whisky in his left hand and a mleccha girl in his right hand 
        walking down the street, Lord Brahma will come and give his full dandavat 
        pranam to Lord Nityananda. Such is His supreme position as the topmost 
        intimate servitor of Lord Chaitanya, the Supreme Absolute Truth. (By the 
        way friends, don't try to imitate Lord Nityananda. Remember the ocean 
        of poison that Lord Siva drank, also not to be imitated by any jiva soul 
        aspiring for devotional service. PK das) </p>

      <p> Dandavat and Hare Krishna. Here is Calcutta on July 8, it is Rathayatra 
        Day. Srila Govinda Maharaj stated that about 600,000 people will celebrate 
        Rathayatra in Puri. Also today, about 28 kilometers from Calcutta, one 
        person Mahesh puts on a Rathayatra Festival for 200,000 people. ISKCON 
        also has its Rathayatra in Calcutta and there is one more such festival 
        in Calcutta as well. Advertisements for Puri Rathayatra have been playing 
        on Indian TV for the past week or so, and there are some large advertisements 
        on big boards on main thoroughfares in Calcutta.</p>
      <p>This morning, Srila Govinda Maharaj is in very good spirits. He spoke 
        with Yudhamanyu Prabhu and his good wife Jivana, myself and some of the 
        temple devotees. He said that today, Jagannath will get dry prasadam, 
        not rice. The pandas who share in the care of the temple will sell the 
        prasadam, ask for donations or sometimes give it away for free. Srila 
        Maharaj said that he thinks there are about 1,200 pandas in Puri. They 
        consider that, when they are taking Their Lordships out for Rathayatra, 
        they are going to take Them to Their aunties' house, i.e. Gundicha Mandir. 
        Of course, the Vaishnavas who have studied Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita 
        can understand how Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Lila celebrated this festival. 
        Pandas like to think of themselves as zamindars or landlords of the Jagannath 
        Temple, although officially that term (landlord = zamindar) is no longer 
        acceptable. The pandas receive a portion of the prasadam of Lord Jagannath 
        regularly, and they feed their families and sell the prasadam. Most of 
        the pandas are well to do.</p>
      <p>When approached by a panda, or seeking one out, they will generally show 
        you around Puri for a donation or fee, something like a tour-guide. In 
        Puri, Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math, like all the other temples, keeps peace 
        and employs the services of a panda to obtain prasadam from Lord Jagannath. 
        Srila Govinda Maharaj said that our panda in Puri is named Gopinath Khutia. 
        His son is Hare Krishna Khutia, and one gentleman, Bubli, is also working 
        with them in a managerial capacity. If you are in Puri and being solicited 
        by various pandas (more the rule than the exception), if you say that 
        we have a panda, Gopinath Khutia, then the other pandas will leave you 
        alone.</p>
      <p>I asked Maharaj if they sing kirtan inside the Jagannath Temple. He said 
        yes, sometimes Jayadeva's Gitagovinda or the 'Jagannatha Swami Nayana 
        Pathagami bhava tu me...,' etc., and sometimes the Hare Krishna Mahamantra.</p>
      <p>Also, a trivial item, how Srila Govinda Maharaj likes to take his mango 
        (it IS mango season in India, you know). Mangos are taken at virtually 
        every meal if you want! He prefers that the skin be cut off where the 
        stalk used to be and then the skin be pealed off by hand, not with a knife, 
        and then present the entire mango without skin and without further cutting 
        it. That is his personal preference. I am not trying to create a rule 
        about this however, but it was humorous. In fact, for breakfast this morning, 
        Srila Maharaj had moori (puffed rice), a ripe mango squeezed into the 
        bowl (without the pith), a sandesh broken up into the bowl, a supplement 
        mix that he uses in the morning, and some water. Srila Maharaj calls the 
        fuzzy mango hair around the pith a &quot;beard&quot; (in Bengali it is 
        called a dhari).</p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj just got off the telephone with Sripad Janardan 
        Maharaj who returned from a preaching tour in the Central and South Americas. 
        His Divine Grace was very satisfied. He is very happy with the Mexico 
        Yatra, the amazing Venezuelan devotees, the happy devotees of Brazil, 
        and he is very happy that Raja Ram Prabhu is taking the lead role under 
        his direction and at the request of Srila Govinda Maharaj to manage the 
        Temple in Ecuador.</p>
      <p>All of the devotees around the world should know that His Divine Grace 
        is well in terms of his health, and even improving a little. Keep in mind 
        that his serious health illnesses occurred about 6 months ago. I take 
        a little license as one of Srila Govinda Maharaj's doctors to let you 
        know that Maharaj is with you all throughout the world in spirit, even 
        though he currently remains in India continuing to recuperate and maintain 
        his fragile health. Please do not be upset or take it wrongly if His Divine 
        Grace does not travel like he used to. He made over twenty world tours, 
        and negotiating a flight of stairs is quite enough for right now. He is 
        incessantly looking at news and pictures of the devotees from around the 
        world mission of Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math. We want and need to protect 
        the good health of the Captain of this glorious ship bound for only one 
        port, Goloka Vrindaban. The future is all in Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's 
        divine Lotus Hands. Hare Krishna.<br>

      <p>Dandavat and Hare Krishna. The floodgates of love for Sri Sri Guru Gauranga 
        opened this morning. Srila Govinda Maharaj began by discussing his health 
        with me, and concluded by saying &quot;sariram vyadhi mandiram,&quot; 
        the body is a temple of disease and misery. He noted that yesterday &quot;our 
        one friend passed away suddenly.&quot; His name was Vijaya (affectionately 
        Vijaya Babu). He lived in Calcutta with his family. He had only one good 
        eye but rode everywhere on his bicycle. He was noted for helping to decorate 
        the temples on festival days. Just yesterday even he was riding his bicycle. 
        His death came unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj related the story of the son of Srivas Pandit. 
        He passed away in the house of Srivas Pandit while Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 
        was having ecstatic kirtan with Srivas and others. Srivas became aware 
        of his son's passing away and did not want to disturb the mood of Sri 
        Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Later, as we know, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu brought 
        the son of Srivas back to life several hours after his passing so that 
        he could instruct everyone on the relativity of the body. </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj quoted several verses from the Srimad Bhagavad 
        Gita: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>na jayate mriyate va kadachin<br>
          nayam bhutva bhavita va na bhuyah<br>
          ajo nityah sasvato 'yam purano<br>
          na hanyate hanyamane sarire</b> (2:20)</p>
        <p>&quot;For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He 
          has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come 
          into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-lasting and primeval. He is 
          not slain when the body is slain.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>na tv evaham jatu nasam<br>
          na tvam neme janadhipah<br>
          na chaiva na bhavisyamah<br>
          sarve vayam atah param</b> (2:12)</p>
        <p>&quot;Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all 
          these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Sripad Bhakti Sudhir Goswami Maharaj asked a question about the significance 
        of the return Rathayatra, when Lord Jagannath, Subhadra and Baladeva return 
        from the Gundicha Mandir (i.e. Vrindaban) to the Jagannath Mandir (i.e. 
        Dwarka). Srila Govinda Maharaj said that not much is given in Sri Chaitanya 
        Charitamrita. It may not have the same significance to Mahaprabhu as the 
        taking of Their Lordships to Gundicha, but Mahaprabhu is having ecstatic 
        kirtan and enjoying with the devotees. </p>
      <p>I asked Srila Govinda Maharaj why Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu started out 
        for Vrindaban once and then turned back and returned to Puri. Sri Chaitanya 
        Mahaprabhu went to Ramakeli and seemed to intend to go on to Vrindaban, 
        but He returned to Nilachala, Puri.</p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj relates that Srila Sanatan Goswami advised Sri 
        Chaitanya Mahaprabhu that with Mahaprabhu being followed by throngs of 
        people, it was not the way for Him to travel to Vrindaban. Mahaprabhu 
        took it that Krishna was speaking through Srila Sanatan Goswami, so Mahaprabhu 
        returned to Puri via Santipur after visiting with Sri Advaita Prabhu and 
        others, only to go to Vrindaban later. Srila Govinda Maharaj related in 
        this context that Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told to Gadadhar that, &quot;You 
        cannot go to Vrindaban, so Krishna has not taken me to Vrindaban.&quot;</p>
      <p>Gadadhar is a 'ksetra sannyas' - &quot;I shall stay here until death.&quot; 
        Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu however is a religious preacher, but Gadadhar 
        was not like that. I suggested and Srila Maharaj agreed that Gadadhar 
        is feeding the fuel to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mood of separation. 
        Srila Govinda Maharaj said: &quot;Heart and halo Mahaprabhu has taken, 
        so what will be the form (of Sri Radha) without heart and halo? Gadadhar. 
        His only service to give nourishment to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In this 
        way, Gadadhar is coming to Him and giving service to the Lord (Sri Chaitanyadeva).&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj explained that the heart and halo of Srimati Radharani 
        was assumed by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So the question raised is: What 
        will be the form of Sri Radharani without heart and halo? She becomes 
        Gadadhar Prabhu, who appears to nourish the deep mood of transcendental 
        separation that Sri Krishna is tasting in His Form as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. 
      </p>
      <p>Gadadhar has many disciples. Srila Guru Maharaj gave a sloka (found in 
        Golden Volcano of Divine Love) about Gadadhar: </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;nilambhodhi-tate sada sva-viraha-ksepanvitam bandhavam<br>
        &nbsp;srimad-bhagavati katha madiraya sanjivayan bhati yah<br>
        &nbsp;srimad-bhagavatam sada sva-nayanasru-payanaih pujayam<br>
        &nbsp;gosvami-prabaro gadadhara-vibhur-bhuyat mad-eka-gatih</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;On the shore of the broad blue ocean, Gadadhar Pandit used to 
          read Srimad Bhagavatam to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who was suffering 
          from the great internal pain of separation from Himself (Krishna). Gadadhar 
          Pandit supplied the wine of Krishna-lila to intoxicate his afflicted 
          friend and give Him relief. As he read, tears would fall from his eyes 
          like flower offerings, onto the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam. May the 
          pleasure of that brilliant personality, Gadadhar Pandit, the best of 
          the Goswamis, be my only object in writing this book.&quot; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj noted that Gadadhar gave all property and heart 
        (whose real identity is Srimati Radharani) to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. 
        Then he (Gadadhar) is vacant, but he has a body and he is giving nourishment 
        to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on the shore of the ocean.</p>
      <p>Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu disappeared from this world and in a dream He 
        instructed Gadadhar to teach Srinivas the Srimad Bhagavatam. Gadadhar 
        wanted to teach Srinivas, who came from Bengal to Puri. Gadadhar said: 
        yes, I have got that from Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. I want to teach you 
        but my book, Srimad Bhagavatam, my &quot;alphabet&quot; (as Srila Govinda 
        Maharaj put it) is lost from tears (i.e. the hand print of Gadadhar's 
        copy was smeared beyond recognition by the tears of love that flowed from 
        Gadadhar when he read the Srimad Bhagavatam to Sri Chaitanyadeva.) Gadadhar 
        told Srinivas to bring one copy from Bengal and he would instruct him. 
      </p>
      <p>Srinivas went to Bengal to secure a copy of the Srimad Bhagavatam, but 
        on the way back to Puri he heard that Gadadhar had also left this world. 
        But, Gadadhar had said: &quot;I shall teach you,&quot; and that was enough 
        to make Srinivas a great teacher of Srimad Bhagavatam. All knowledge appeared 
        to Srinivas. That was sufficient for Srinivas: that Gadadhar had said 
        &quot;I will teach you.&quot; </p>
      <p>How much valuable is that knowledge? Srinivas went to Vrindaban and there 
        was a great celebration taking place. He inquired and discovered that 
        Srila Rupa Goswami had also just disappeared. Distraught he then was given 
        shelter by, and he learned under, Srila Jiva Goswami, and Srila Jiva Goswami 
        entrusted all the written works of the Goswamis to Srinivas. </p>
      <p>Srinivas, Syamananda and Narottama Das were travelling by bullock cart 
        with the works of the Goswamis of Vrindaban. They passed through a kingdom 
        where the king was named Birhamvir. His astrologer said that these mendicants 
        were carrying the greatest treasure. The king had his men steal a trunk 
        containing the books. None in the king's entourage, however, could make 
        sense of this treasure. Anyway, one day one of the king's scholars was 
        trying to interpret Srimad Bhagavatam and Srinivas was present. Srinivas 
        was asked to elaborate on the Srimad Bhagavatam after being dissatisfied 
        with the king's scholar's words. </p>
      <p>The heart of King Birhamvir was melted by the explanation of Srinivas. 
        The king asked Srinivas to go on explaining more, but Srinivas said that 
        he would if he could have back the books that were taken from him. The 
        king said that, &quot;I have those books, I had stolen them.&quot; In 
        this way, the treasures in the form of the Goswami's works were returned 
        to Srinivas so that he could return to Nabadwip. Srinivas gave initiation 
        to the king and his son, Gopal, who became the king after his father. 
        Gopal as king enforced a rule that anyone in his kingdom had to chant 
        Hare Krishna (Srila Govinda Maharaj jokingly said &quot;4 rounds&quot;). 
        The king even had spies to make sure that all his subjects were chanting, 
        otherwise they would be removed from the kingdom. <a name="gsingh"></a>Some 
        people would joke that the king was &quot;Beggar of Gopal.&quot; Gopal 
        Singh the beggar (<a href="#beggar">please see the later note</a> on 13th 
        July), but without payment he is begging, for he is only asking his subjects 
        to chant the Holy Names.</p>
      <p> At this point Srila Govinda Maharaj said how Srila Guru Maharaj's Godbrother, 
        Srila Puri Maharaj was very simple hearted and greatly appreciated Srila 
        Guru Maharaj's presentation of Krishna Consciousness. </p>
      <p>This is enough to digest for today. Tomorrow I will share some of Srila 
        Govinda Maharaj's comments about Jagannath prasadam. <b><a name="jul10pm"></a></b></p>

      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj today praised the simple-hearted faith of Yudhamanyu 
        Prabhu Seva Vikram who is endeavouring to introduce Krishna consciousness 
        in China. All that is necessary is faith in Krishna, Guru and Vaishnava. 
        One does not have to be a highly learned devotee to do this. Simply a 
        sincere desire to please Krishna, Guru and Vaishnava. </p>
      <p>Top to bottom, everything in Krishna consciousness is based on faith. 
      </p>
      <p>There are two paths: raga-bhakti and vaidhi-bhakti. Srila Govinda Maharaj 
        said that he is acharya so he must see that there is rule and regulation 
        so that things are not approached whimsically. But, raga-bhakti is very 
        good. It is based on faith and love, a desire to please Guru and Krishna. 
        Devotion is the essential ingredient. He emphasized this over and over. 
        Devotion is the essential ingredient. </p>
      <p>He gave an example. Sometimes one may obtain Jagannath prasad from a 
        vendor, but it was not actually offered to the Deity. If one is faithful 
        and devoted, &quot;how I am honoring Jagannath prasad,&quot; without lobha 
        (greed), then the Supreme Lord will be pleased and transform this into 
        prasadam. Even taking prasadam offered to Jagannath is maximally beneficial 
        with faith and devotion. It is a question of trying to please Guru and 
        Krishna. </p>
      <p>Hrishikesha hrishikena sevanam, bhaktir ucyate. One's senses are for 
        the pleasure of Krishna, not for oneself for one's own selfish mood.</p>
      <p>All is depending on faith and devotion.</p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj told a story of how Srila Guru Maharaj and several 
        other sannyasi godbrothers went to Kashmir to preach. They looked for 
        a vegetarian hotel to eat in. They bought rice, dahl, vegetables like 
        that. One of the godbrothers commented that there is &quot;onion&quot; 
        in the soup. Another Godbrother retorted saying, &quot;be quiet, this 
        is prasadam.&quot; All is depending upon the faith of the devotee. Sometimes 
        even normally undesirable things have utility in Guru and Krishna's service. 
      </p>
      <p>There is another extreme story you may have heard. There was one hunter 
        that used to weigh the meat that he sold on a scale. One of the counter-balance 
        weights that the hunter used was a Salagram-sila (a form of Narayan). 
        One day, a brahman strictly following the rules and regulations (vaidhi 
        marga) noticed and chastised the hunter for this and requested that he, 
        the brahmana, instead worship the Salagram-sila with proper application 
        of the rules and regulations for that worship. The brahman did so but 
        Lord Narayan in that form was unhappy. He came to the brahman in a dream 
        and expressed that the hunter was a great devotee of Lord Narayan, and 
        the Lord in His Salagram-sila Form was very happy swinging on the scale 
        of the hunter, His devotee. Due to this dream, the brahman returned the 
        Salagram-sila to the hunter realizing his mistake. </p>
      <p>These stories of raga-bhakti are intended to exemplify the nature of 
        faith and devotion that transcends all rules and regulations. The essential 
        ingredient however is faith and devotion. This was the take home message 
        of Srila Govinda Maharaj. His Divine Grace said he sometimes appreciated 
        the Western devotees in this regard, being sometimes more spontaneous 
        than the bhaktas brought up in India. I suggested that he may be mistaking 
        ignorance for spontaneity, at which he laughed, and went in to take his 
        morning bath. </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj has been very open this morning to giving instruction, 
        and I told him how we are trying to give this to the devotees worldwide 
        on the website to nourish the devotees that are suffering from separation 
        from him. He was very satisfied and said, &quot;Yes.&quot; His Divine 
        Grace's soft heart is always with the faithful and devoted bhaktas throughout 
        the world. He spends hours daily looking at the pictures of the Sri Chaitanya 
        Saraswat Mission throughout the world and with great appreciation and 
        affection for all the efforts to please Sri Sri Guru Gauranga. </p>
      <p>This morning he spent a lot of time showing these pictures to Urmila 
        Devi Dasi, the visiting Chinese devotee. She will be going to Nabadwip 
        soon to visit the Mother Math. She is very happy and she was especially 
        amazed to see the large Russian yatra with temple, restaurants, large 
        preaching programs, all in a formerly staunchly communist country. Anyone 
        can see that the Will of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu must prevail due to 
        His very nature as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Cause of All 
        Causes, and the Supreme Controller. We are very fortunate to be a part 
        of His divine lila of Sri Krishna Sankirtan. Hare Krishna.</p>

      <p> I want to share with you the sentiments of one devotee who left yesterday 
        to return to his native Venezuela. Srila Govinda Maharaj was out from 
        the Math at the time he had to leave, so he dictated to me a message which 
        I later read to Srila Govinda Maharaj who heard it attentively with folded 
        hands and expressing, &quot;Jaya Guru Maharaj.&quot; What can I say? I 
        am also so moved by his simple expression of love for his Gurudeva, Srila 
        Govinda Maharaj, that it must be shared with others to hear the beautiful 
        sentiments that come from the bhaktas. I hope that Ishwara Prasad will 
        not be offended by me that I share his feelings with others, and I know 
        that he will not feel pride, because his heart is already so soft and 
        melted by Sri Gurudeva and Lord Jagannath. He attended the Rathayatra 
        in Puri, and his smiling face was almost as big as the smile on the face 
        of Lord Jagannath Himself. Anyway, when leaving the Math to go to the 
        Kolkata (Calcutta) airport, this is the message that Prabhu Ishwara Prasad 
        wanted delivered to Maharaj. Incidentally, earlier that same day Ishwara 
        Prasad Das arranged a fire yajna in the Calcutta Math in remembrance of 
        his deceased father. This was followed by sumptuous and opulent prasadam.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;Dear Gurudeva,<br>
          This was the best experience of my life to be here. I am very thankful 
          for everything that you have given us. Today's ceremony was very special. 
          I hope to be serving you for many lives. Now, you are my father...<br>
          My love, Ishwara Prasad das&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Hare Krishna. I will be here in Calcutta with Srila Govinda Maharaj for 
        another ten days, and am thankful to have the opportunity to share moments 
        such as these with the devotee community throughout the world. Hare Krishna.<b><a name="jul12b"></a></b></p>

      <p> This morning after giving second initiation to Dyuti Krishna dd from 
        Australia, Srila Govinda Maharaj went into deep thought again how fortunate 
        we are to have Krishna consciousness in this lifetime. He quoted a number 
        of verses highlighting this including Bhagavad Gita 7.19, Srimad Bhagavatam 
        11.2.29 &amp; 6.14.5 which highlight the extraordinary rarity it is to 
        have gotten entry into Krishna consciousness. Crores and crores of people 
        but so few have taken to Krishna consciousness.</p>
      <p><a name="prapto"></a>His Divine Grace said that he has seen so much good 
        and bad in his lifetime. &quot;Still, even though I may feel that I have 
        nothing, still Das Goswami has said that what we have received from Sri 
        Gurudeva, it is fact, <a href="#prapto2">prapto,</a> we have received 
        it.&quot;</p>
      <p>He quoted the famous sloka found on p.70 of Sri Guru and His Grace: &quot;Nama-srestham.......&quot; 
        What we have gotten, this we have gotten all from our Gurudeva.</p>
      <p>Then, of those who do not take to Krishna, so many asura, asuram bhavam 
        asritah (quoting BG 7.15), and mudha. Srila Govinda Maharaj noted how 
        Srila AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupad would often use this word, mudha 
        (and we all interjected, yes, &quot;fools and rascals&quot;).</p>
      <p>His Divine Grace then sat down to his breakfast of moori sweetened with 
        the juice of rasgulla or gulabjamon.</p>
      <p>I tried writing this out one time before and it was long and very elaborate 
        with the quotes from the books and their translations. Just as I was finishing, 
        it disappeared from the computer. I can only take this as Krishna's will. 
        Perhaps He wants you to look into the books to find those quotes and translations 
        since Krishna is non-different form of Srimad Bhagavad Gita and Srimad 
        Bhagavatam. Anyway, Srila Govinda Maharaj is wanting to say that it is 
        so very, very rare to get this and when getting it, we must acknowledge, 
        as Das Goswami (Raghunath Das) has that what we have gotten, it all has 
        come from Sri Gurudeva.<br>

      <p>Dandavat and Hare Krishna. </p>
      <p>This morning Srila Govinda Maharaj was looking at the Panjika or Vaishnava 
        Calendar. I asked him what he was looking at. He told me that the Vaishnava 
        Calendar is listing the holy days and appearance and disappearance days 
        of the Vaishnavas. He noted that tomorrow, 14th. July, is the disappearance 
        day of Ajita Krishna Prabhu. Ajita Krishna Brahmachari was one of three 
        stalwart brahmachari servitors of the Math in the earlier days after Srila 
        Govinda Maharaj had come to the Math. Others included Ramendu Brahmachari 
        who later became a grihastha, and Krishna Govinda Das Brahmachari, who 
        also has passed on. One householder Laksmi Narayan Das was a grihastha 
        servitor also who gave so much energy to the mission then.</p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj praised the character and quality of Ajita Krishna 
        Das as follows. He was 24 hours per day engaged in service to Srila Guru 
        Maharaj and the Math. Srila Govinda Maharaj said that he was so helpful, 
        that the Math would not be what it is today without him. He would do everything 
        even without being asked and never had any complaint. He would milk the 
        cows, cook and do pujari seva. Every day, and all day long, Ajita Krishna 
        was engaged in such wonderful devotional service. Srila Guru Maharaj was 
        very pleased with him.</p>
      <p>One day in July many years ago, the young Ajita Krishna who was only 
        in his early 30's, was making ghee wicks for offering during arotik. There 
        was one guava tree, not too big, but heavily laden with guava fruit. Ajita 
        Krishna saw that some of the fruit might fall to the ground and then not 
        be offerable to the Deities. He climbed into the guava tree and was collecting 
        the fruit for His Lordships when one of the branches of the tree broke. 
        Ajita Krishna Prabhu fell to the earth striking his head and dying instantly. 
        There was nothing that anyone could do. Srila Guru Maharaj cried for this 
        wonderful servitor of Mahaprabhu, and Srila Govinda Maharaj thus remembered 
        him gloriously today. </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj mentioned that at that time there was a &quot;good 
        wave&quot; and there were many devoted strongly dedicated servitors. Later, 
        a less favorable wave came and affected not only the Math, but other missions 
        as well. </p>
      <p>In this way, Srila Govinda Maharaj's thoughts then turned to the disappearance 
        of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Although we do not relish discussing the 
        disappearance of our Lord, Srila Govinda Maharaj made instructive points 
        for us to understand. Generally, there have been three possibilities proposed 
        for the disappearance lila of Mahaprabhu. Nobody knows for sure. One possibility 
        was that Mahaprabhu entered the Form of Lord Jagannath. Another, and the 
        most palatable for the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, is that He entered the Deity 
        of Gopinath. Finally, it had been suggested that Mahaprabhu entered the 
        ocean and never returned.</p>
      <p>We really do not know how any of the Panchatattva disappeared from our 
        vision in this world. Sri Krishna Chaitanya, Prabhu Nityananda, Sri Advaita, 
        Sri Gadadhar, Srivas Prabhu. We do not know how any of these Personalities 
        left. Some people have engaged in vikriti (or disfigurement) to engage 
        in attempts at historical mundane research to determine how Sri Chaitanya 
        Mahaprabhu disappeared. A sloka was given about this, but it is not from 
        the authorized Scriptures and it is not accepted by pure Vaishnavas. In 
        this way, simply because something has been written does not make it so. 
        Srila Govinda Maharaj cautioned one not to follow or accept that path 
        of speculation. What is in the shastra, and authorized shastra, that is 
        accepted. In this way, Srila Govinda Maharaj recounted about one man in 
        Puri who was trying to do historical research to prove how Mahaprabhu 
        left this world. That man was found dead with his head in a bucket of 
        water (Goswami Maharaj elucidated, that means in the toilet bowl). His 
        wife also met with an untimely accident and died. </p>
      <p>I recalled how one of my former acquaintances had gone to Srila Guru 
        Maharaj many years ago and brought up the issue of whether the moon is 
        closer to the earth planet, or whether the sun was closer to the earth 
        planet. Srila Guru Maharaj explained to that gentleman that it does not 
        matter which is the case, but how Srila Sukadeva Goswami saw it, that 
        is presented in Srimad Bhagavatam, and that is important. </p>
      <p>Srila Govinda Maharaj then offered that there are three concepts, all 
        according to the capacity of the individual. One is heliocentric (the 
        sun is the center), the another is geocentric (the earth or humanity is 
        the center), and the third and the one which we are following is God-centric: 
        Krishna consciousness. All is depending on one's capacity. This is a theme 
        that Srila Govinda Maharaj has also used in recent days. We hear something 
        from authorized sources, Guru &amp; Shastra, but different individuals 
        will understand it differently, based upon the capacity of the individual.</p>
      <p> <a name="prapto2"></a>Finally, there are two clarifications that need 
        to be made. One is use of the word <a href="#prapto">&quot;prapto&quot;</a> 
        yesterday. This means that &quot;I have got it,&quot; that is, all of 
        what Raghunath Das Goswami, our prayojana Acharya has received, &quot;Nama 
        sresta, etc.&quot;, that I have gotten all by the grace of Sri Gurudeva.</p>
      <p> <a name="beggar"></a>Secondly, several days ago I described <a href="#gsingh">Gopal 
        Singh</a>, the son of the king that stole and later returned the sacred 
        writings of the Goswamis, was described as a Beggar, asking people to 
        chant the Holy Names of the Lord within his kingdom or they would have 
        to leave. In fact, Srila Govinda Maharaj was using some other word that 
        sounds like beggar but he thinks may be an Urdu word. In summary, Gopal 
        Singh told his subjects that you will chant the Holy Names or you will 
        be, forcefully if necessary, removed from his kingdom, hence he was not 
        a beggar, but some other word that described his staunch and forceful 
        injunction to chant the Lord's Holy Names, and without payment. Hare Krishna.</p>
      <p>By the way, it has been raining practically every day. Last night was 
        a powerful rain storm with heavy rolling thunder which accompanied the 
        storm. So far the tank or pond across the street has not flooded. So happy 
        to be here in Calcutta, sequestered with Srila Govinda Maharaj.</p>
