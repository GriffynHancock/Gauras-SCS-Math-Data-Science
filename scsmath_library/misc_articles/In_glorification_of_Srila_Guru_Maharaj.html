      <hr>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are 
        all eternally fortunate to be able to remember and praise the outstanding 
        qualities of Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Srila 
        Guru Maharaj, as he is affectionately called by his followers, is our 
        real &quot;Guardian of Devotion,&quot; who has appeared in this world 
        to give us the most beautiful and elevated perception of what is Reality, 
        and at the same time to protect the devotion of innumerable souls who 
        have taken shelter at his lotus feet.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 
        the <i>Sri</i> <i>Chaitanya-charitamrita, </i>Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami, 
        remarks that even Sesa Naga, with thousands and thousands of mouths, speaking 
        for eternity, could not exhaust the glories of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. 
        So, not to make an excuse for my own inability, but to express what is 
        certain, I also have to say that no presentation could really adequately 
        glorify what are the unlimited devotional qualities of Srila Guru Maharaj.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
        have heard that Sri Krishnadas Babaji, the dear Godbrother of Srila Guru 
        Maharaj, often visited Sri Hapaniya Dham, the divine place of his appearance. 
        When Srila Babaji Maharaj was asked why he visited there<i>, </i>why he 
        paid so much respect to the place of birth of a Godbrother, he replied 
        that all his life he was hearing and singing the poetry and songs of Srila 
        Rupa Goswami Prabhupad, and had concluded, &quot;I do not see any difference 
        between what you have written and what he has given.&quot; It was his 
        conclusion that their expressions were of the same quality.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> From 
        the time that Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, before his imminent 
        departure from this world, asked Srila Guru Maharaj to sing <i>Sri Rupa-manjari-pada, 
        </i>the most revered and beautiful expression of our highest ideal, Srila 
        Guru Maharaj's most elevated and trusted Godbrothers all held him in a 
        special position. Great spiritual personalities who were present at that 
        time felt that when Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Prabhupad asked Srila 
        Guru Maharaj to sing, that a divine transmission occurred in which Srila 
        Prabhupad chose Srila Guru Maharaj as the representative of the line of 
        Srila Rupa Goswami as the guardian of our mission. And like Srila Babaji 
        Maharaj, Srila Guru Maharaj's Godbrothers sought his advice and his approval, 
        even those who were senior to him in the mission of Srila Saraswati Thakur.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Srila 
        Guru Maharaj captured the hearts of everyone, both faithful followers 
        and adversaries, not only because he was the most qualified representative 
        of our line, and chosen by his Guru, but because of his natural qualities 
        and the purity of his heart. Once a rival, a person from another philosophical 
        camp, came to hear from Srila Guru Maharaj. That person was respected 
        in the community as a great and erudite scholar. When Guru Maharaj saw 
        him, he asked him why he had come to visit him. That man expressed, &quot;That 
        is because in you we see three unique qualities: super intelligence, a 
        disinterested nature and strong common sense.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
        is the nature of this world that even a saint is sometimes abused or not 
        understood. We have heard Srila Govinda Maharaj, the chosen successor 
        and intimate disciple of Srila Guru Maharaj, express that when a thesis 
        is presented, immediately the antithesis also arises. Srila Guru Maharaj 
        could confront any challenge and defend the dignity of the Gaudiya Vaishnava 
        line.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Once 
        in Karachi, Srila Guru Maharaj was challenged, &quot;If the infinitesimal 
        can understand the Infinite, then He is not infinite.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This, 
        of course, refers to the understanding that if the conditioned soul can 
        know the infinite Lord, then He would not be truly infinite. But Srila 
        Guru Maharaj simply replied, &quot;If the Infinite cannot make Himself 
        known to the infinitesimal, then He is not infinite.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> No 
        one could defeat him in an argument, and in his presence, no other line 
        could have pre-eminence.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But 
        in his own words, Srila Guru Maharaj described himself as a &quot;back-pushing 
        man.&quot; He would never take the initiative in a violent confrontation, 
        and even when personally attacked, he would say, &quot;Is that all they 
        have to say about me. That is not so bad. I am much worse than that.&quot; 
        He beautifully demonstrated Sri Gauranga's advice of always exhibiting 
        humility, tolerance and<i> </i>respect for others. This he did naturally, 
        because his heart was so magnanimous and full of all those Vaishnava qualities 
        and sentiments.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
        are most fortunate that in Srila Guru Maharaj's advanced age, he has accepted 
        us and given us a place in his heart. We have come in contact with the 
        highest Vaishnava, who is of the<i> </i>magnitude of the great Acharyyas 
        in our line, whose conclusions are unique, and who has made his own singular 
        contribution to our <i>Sampradaya.</i></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> His 
        writings, such as <i>Sri Sri Prapanna</i>-<i>jivanamritam, Prema-dhama-deva-stotram, 
        </i>his commentaries on <i>Sharanagati, </i>on the <i>Bhagavad-gita </i>and 
        <i>Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu,</i> and his many bhajans, songs, and <i>aratis</i> 
        are invaluable contributions to the <i>Rupanuga Gaudiya Sampradaya.</i> 
        And his commentary on the Gayatri mantra, which presents an understanding 
        in the line of <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam </i>which proceeds to <i>Radha-dasyam, 
        </i>has never been given before by any Acharyya and will be eternally 
        appreciated by the true followers of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
        are fortunate that at an advanced age, when he expressed himself with 
        so much maturity and compassion, we have the words of Srila Guru Maharaj 
        expressed in so many beautiful English books, which have now been translated 
        into many other languages. When Srila Govinda Maharaj read Srila Guru 
        Maharaj's explanations of Mahaprahbu's <i>Sikshastakam, </i>translated 
        from its original English into Bengali, he very much appreciated them, 
        and remarked that Guru Maharaj had commented many important things that 
        had not been heard by the Bengali devotees.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
        is a fact that Srila Guru Maharaj has given us so many important precepts 
        and mature spiritual understandings that are essential to our eternal 
        development. Without those conclusions it is extremely difficult, if not 
        impossible, to view one's own development correctly or focus on what is 
        essential for one's own growth. For that reason, we are truly fortunate 
        that we have had an opportunity to take shelter at his lotus feet. It 
        is our greatest fortune, and the most important occurrence in our entire 
        life.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
        entire world is fortunate that Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada has 
        directed<b> </b>all humanity towards the shelter of Srila Guru Maharaj's 
        feet, and those that have sufficient <i>sukriti</i> have taken his divine 
        directive as their true salvation. By entrusting us to the shelter of 
        Srila Govinda Maharaj, we can feel Srila Guru Maharaj's divine presence 
        and concern for our eternal well-being. We can understand that Srila Guru 
        Maharaj is eternally with us, and this will always be felt in the association 
        of his true successor, Srila Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami Maharaj.</font></p>
