          He gave <i>Sri Krishna sankirttana</i> the highest place above all, 
          and He conclusively taught that the chanting of Krishna's Holy Names 
          with devotion is the only means of support and sustenance of every living 
          being within the universe. I sing with joy the unending glories of my 
          Golden Lord, Gaurasundar the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love.<br>

      <p align="justify"> <span class="body"><img src="gkunda-150x.jpg" width="150" height="109" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" border="1">In 
        holy Sridham Nabadwip the gardens surrounding Sri Govinda Kunda are now 
        opulent with the rich colors and fragrance of hundreds of marigolds and 
        dahlias. I am remembering them. But here, in Oregon, springtime is still 
        cold and rainy and the flowers are just now hesitantly, shyly beginning 
        to unfurl their brilliant petals. Perfumed puffs of pink and white blossoms 
        fill the fruit trees and hold the promise of sweet offerings of cherries, 
        plums, apples and pears. Nearby, the towering fir trees are glittering 
        with raindrops, and the long wet winter has left patches of soft moss 
        on the branches that, at first glance, cruelly fools the eye into thinking 
        they are the shimmering green of parrots like the ones seen in the Holy 
        Dham. </span></p>
      <p align="justify"> On the most anticipated and holy Advent Day of Sri Gaurahari, 
        we prepare and wait for evening and for the rising of the luminous full 
        moon as a reminder of our Golden Lord, the Benediction Moon of our good 
        fortune. But as darkness falls, heavy blue-gray clouds eclipse the bright 
        circle of moon and I think of one of the verses from the <i>Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta</i> 
        that Srila Gurudev sings on this occasion: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>a-kalanka gaurachandra dila darasana<br>
          sa-kalanka chandre ara kon prayojana </b></p>
        <p> <font color="#333333">When the spotless moon of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 
          became visible, what would be the need for a moon full of black marks 
          on its body? </font></p>

      <p align="justify"> <span class="body"><img src="talk2-150x.jpg" width="150" height="113" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" border="1"></span>At 
        The Golden Road preaching center in Eugene, Oregon, preparations for the 
        observance of Sri Gaura-Purnima begin early Thursday when guests arrive 
        for the regular <i>Bhagavad-gita</i> class. Then all day Friday the devotees, 
        headed by Krishnangini Devi Dasi, Sita Devi Dasi and Sraddhamayi Devi 
        Dasi, lovingly decorate the center and cook dozens of sumptuous preparations 
        for Mahaprabhu's 520th Divine Appearance Day. The festivities of <i>kirttan,</i> 
        classes and offerings continue on Saturday with the Anandotsav of Sri 
        Jagannath Misra and into the regular Saturday evening program of Hari<i>-kirttan,</i> 
        Hari<i>-katha</i> and holy <i>prasadam.</i> </p>
      <p align="justify"> There is a feeling of fresh and happy enthusiasm at 
        The Golden Road. Eight young people from Eugene made the journey south 
        to seek the <i>darshan</i> and grace of Srila Govinda Maharaj while he 
        was recently in Soquel. They returned shining, with new spiritual names 
        and with the seed of devotion planted in their hearts. When the new initiates 
        went to give their offerings at the lotus feet of His Divine Grace, he 
        commented that they were all very pious young people and he placed them 
        in the care of Mathuranath Prabhu, noting that he was very capable and 
        qualified to guide them. </p>
      <p align="justify"> <span class="body"><img src="kirtan5.jpg" width="150" height="113" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" border="1"></span>On 
        the evening of Sri Gaura Purnima, close to forty-five devotees and guests 
        seek shelter from the rain and gather under the gracious glance of our 
        Divine Guru<i>-varga</i> to hear and taste the sweetness of Mahaprabhu's 
        <i>lila.</i> It seems as if the entire room has taken on a warm golden 
        glow as many new initiates mingle with older devotees of our Math and 
        visiting disciples of Srila A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupad. The mood 
        is open, friendly and joyful in this blossoming community and one can 
        feel that fresh enthusiasm in the sweet exchanges of the devotees. </p>
      <p align="justify"> The flames of a large fire flicker in the fireplace 
        and the spirited <i>kirttan</i> and lovely Hari<i>-katha</i> create a 
        feeling of &quot;home sweetness.&quot; Following the talks and <i>kirttan</i> 
        the temple room is alive with excited conversations between new and old 
        friends as a delicious feast of holy <i>prasadam</i> is shared. </p>
      <p align="justify"> <span class="body"><img src="gaura.jpg" width="150" height="101" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="left" border="1"></span>Who 
        can describe the glories of Mahaprabhu whom Sri Jiva Goswami cried out 
        to and addressed as that brilliant golden jewel Sri Chaitanya? To whom 
        Srila Thakur Bhaktivinoda prayed, &quot;All glories to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, 
        the golden moon. All glories to Nityananda Prabhu. All glories to Sri 
        Gadadhar Pandit. All glories to Srivas Thakur and all the devotees of 
        the Lord. All glories to Sri Nabadwip-Dham, the home of devotees and the 
        king of all holy places.&quot; </p>
      <p align="justify"> Reading from <i>sastra</i> and repeating the words of 
        Sri Guru and Vaisnava, the talks about Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu are so 
        beautiful that I wish I could hear the words again and again. The speaker 
        then quotes Srila Prabodhananda Saraswati Thakur: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <b>yatha yatha gaura padaravinde<br>
          vindeta bhaktim krta punya rasi<br>
          tatha tathot sarpati hrdy akasmad<br>

        <p> <span class="body"><font color="#333333">&quot;To the extent that 
          we can give ourselves fully to Sri Gauranga, a flood of ever-increasing 
          Radha<i>-dasyam,</i> Guru<i>-bhakti</i> will awaken within our heart. 
          As much as we can devote ourselves to the lotus feet of Sri Gauranga 
          we will receive the divine service of Srimati Radharani in Vrindavan.&quot; 
          </font></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><span class="body">In The Golden Volcano Srila Guru Maharaj 
        says that an investment in Nabadwip-Dham will automatically take one to 
        Vrindavan. Because for those who have a recommendation from Nabadwip, 
        Srimati Radharani will accept them in Her Holy Service. Therefore, those 
        who have the highest fortune invest everything in the service of Lord 
        Gauranga and there they find that everything is perfectly offered to the 
        divine feet of Srimati Radharani. </span></p>
      <p align="justify"> Lord Krishna comes in every <i>yuga,</i> but in this 
        age He has come to give us what He is relishing the most. He is overwhelmed 
        and completely under the influence of His potency, Srimati Radharani<i> 
        -- Radha bhava dyuti suvalitam naumi Krsna swarupam --</i> Krishna, defeated 
        by the radiant, shining heart of Srimati Radharani is transformed into 
        Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He has accepted a golden complexion and the 
        form of a devotee to share with us what Lord Krishna gave only to His 
        most intimate circle -- Love of God, Krishna-<i>prema.</i> Sweetness or 
        <i>madhurya,</i> made even sweeter by adding, <i>audarya</i> -- generous 
        and undiscriminating distribution of Divine Love. Srila Guru Maharaj has 
        said that only Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu can give the conception of full-fledged 
        theism. It is His grace. His sweet will. It is His own wealth. The golden 
        gift of Mahaprabhu is that in all the ten directions, He is distributing 
        unlimited streams of sweet Krishna<i>-lila</i> to the world. </p>
      <p align="justify"> Ever new streams and channels are being created through 
        the dynamic flood of Mahaprabhu's living, growing <i>sankirttan</i> movement 
        of aspiring devotees. What was initiated by Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, 
        expanded and solidified by Srila Saraswati Thakur, taken all over the 
        world by Srila Swami Maharaj Prabhupad and deepened, protected, clarified 
        and sweetened by Srila Guru Maharaj has been again taken over the face 
        of the earth in ever-new sweetness and depth by Srila Govinda Maharaj 
        in a continual and ever-expanding tsunami of nectarine waves -- flooding 
        the hearts of the world-wide devotees. <i>Tatha tathot sarpati hrdy akasmad.

      <p> <b><font size="+1">In Separation</font></b> </p>
      <p align="justify"> <span class="body"><img src="logo_from_russian_140x.jpg" width="131" height="90" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" border="1"></span>His 
        Divine Grace Srila Govinda Maharaj has often said that the sun never sets 
        on Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math. When the sun is sinking below the horizon 
        here in the West, it is rising in India. Now, our effulgent Sun, His Divine 
        Grace Srila Govinda Maharaj, has left the West and gone back to the holy 
        land of Sri Nabadwip. We are missing his divine physical presence and 
        remembering his sweet pastimes. When our sky grows dark we think of the 
        sun on the other side of the earth as it rises over Sri Govinda Kunda 
        and illuminates the Holy Dham. When we have daylight, Srila Gurudev and 
        the devotees there are taking their sweet rest. Between us are miles of 
        land and water. </p>
      <p align="justify"> Srila Guru Maharaj once said that the pain of separation 
        is able to enter into the heart much more than cheerfulness. And Srila 
        Bhaktivinoda Thakur has prayed: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <b>tomara sevaya duhkha haya yata<br>
          seo ta&iacute; parama sukha<br>
          seva-sukha-duhkha parama sampada<br>

        <p> <span class="body"><font color="#333333">&quot;The suffering that 
          comes from Your service is also our supreme happiness. Both the suffering 
          and the happiness that come from Your service are our greatest treasure, 
          and they destroy the miseries that come from ignorance.&quot;</font> 
          </span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"> Even when the sun has set and is out of sight it is 
        still giving us warmth and nourishment. Similarly, we know that physical 
        proximity is not the most important thing in spiritual life. Often, Mahaprabhu 
        would send His devotees away to serve in separation. In <i>The Divine 
        Servitor,</i> Srila Govinda Maharaj reminds us that the Guru's presence 
        is found in his message, in his instructions and in his guidance. We take 
        sweet comfort in this. </p>
      <p align="justify"> We write these reflections as an offering for the pleasure 
        of Srila Acharyyadev, His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami 
        Maharaj who is an immeasurable ocean of mercy, and for the Vaisnavas who 
        are like the rainclouds that kindly distribute that mercy. </p>
