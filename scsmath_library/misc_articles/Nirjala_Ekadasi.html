This Pandava <em>nirjal-ekadasi</em> takes place at the hottest     time, usually in June, in the high summer season.</p>  <p> Srila Sridhar Maharaj explains the history behind this <em>ekadasi</em>:</p>  <p> "Bhima could not control his hunger: his hunger was like a serious disease.     So he approached Vedavyasa and said: 'There are many stories in the <em>shastras</em>     in praise of observing <em>ekadasi</em> but it is not possible for me to fast.     I can't tolerate hunger, so how can I observe Ekadasi? Please recommend something     for me.'</p>  <p> "Srila Vedavyasa then advised: 'You must observe at least one <em>ekadasi</em>     in the year, this Pandava <em>nirjal-ekadasi.</em> At this hottest time of     the year, you shall not take even one drop of water.' So it was sanctioned     like that. Bhima observed only one <em>ekadasi,</em> without a drop of water."</p>  <p> Of course, this concession was made for the Pandava, Bhima &mdash; also     known by the epithet <em>Vrikodarah,</em> the voracious eater &mdash; in the     <em>Dvapara Yuga,</em> but many devotees who have not strictly or properly     followed <em>ekadasi</em> throughout the year observe this <em>nirjal-ekadasi</em>     as a way of atoning for their transgressions.</p>  <p> Generally, though, such strict fasting is not recommended. In <em>The Golden     Staircase,</em> Srila Guru Maharaj says:</p>  <p> "It is described in the <em>shastras</em> that in <em>Satya Yuga,</em> as     long as a man's bones exist, that is how long he will live. Along with the     longevity of the bones, the life will be there. In <em>Treta Yuga</em> life     may be maintained by the nervous system. And it is stated that in <em>Kali     Yuga</em> one's longevity depends on food.</p>  <p> "In <em>Kali Yuga </em>it is not possible to live without food. The only     continuous fast allowed in <em>Kali Yuga </em> is for twenty-four hours: not     more than that. Twenty-four hour fasting is the maximum allowed, because without     food a man cannot survive."</p>  <p> Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupad did not advocate unnecessary     fasting either. His maxim was: "Take full <em>prasadam,</em> and do full <em>seva.</em>"     He preached: "Take whatever is necessary for the cause of Krishna, not for     your own cause. You are Krishna's: if you grow weak, your service will be     hampered, and you will be the loser."</p>  <p> So take full <em>prasadam,</em> and do full service!</p>  <br>  <div id="date"></div>  <br>  <!-- BEGIN footer -->  <div id="line"></div>  <a href="http://www.imonk.net/04/may3.html">Previous</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imonk.net/archive.html">Archive</a>   &nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imonk.net/mail/index.html">Letters</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp;   <a href="http://www.imonk.net/info/index.html">About</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp; <a href="http://www.imonk.net/feedback.html">Feedback</a>   <div id="line"></div>  <img src="itilak.gif" width="22" height="40"             align="left" alt="iMonk Tilak"> Layout by <a href="http://www.imonk.net/info/index.html">iMonk</a>   &mdash; May 30th, 2004.<br>  <!-- END footer -->  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br clear="all">  </font>   <hr>  <font color="#99CCCC"><font color="#4A697E">One day's excerpt, posted here for   reference at:<br>  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial" size=2><img src="../../../grfx/icon_tilak_trnsprnt.gif" width=28 height=40 align="left"><font color="#000000">Sri   Chaitanya Saraswat Math, Nabadwip<br>  <a href="http://scsmath.com">http://scsmath.com</a><br>  </font> </font></font></div></BODY></HTML>
