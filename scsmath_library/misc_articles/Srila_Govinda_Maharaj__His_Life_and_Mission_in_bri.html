                Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj, his Guru and the founder of this 
                Mission, surprised everyone by announcing that his young disciple

                Govinda Maharaj lived forty-two years in the close association 
                of his Gurudev, and was prepared by him. During that time Srila 
                Sridhar Dev-Goswami gave his association and deep love, and firmly 
                established him as his most prominent disciple.</font></p>

                Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math was started in 1941, more than twenty 
                five years before ISKCON. The founder of ISKCON, Srila Bhaktivedanta 
                Swami Prabhupad considered Srila Sridhar Maharaj as his Siksha-Guru. 
                He considered Srila Govinda Maharaj as his dearmost son, and taught 
                him Srimad Bhagavad-gita. Srila Govinda Maharaj is continuing 
                the world preaching of Krishna consciousness with the spirit and 
                dedication shown by Srila Prabhupad. His Mission is distinct from 
                ISKCON, but Srila Govinda Maharaj has much appreciation for their 
                preaching work, and is well respected by the devotees of that 
                institution.</font></p>

                Sridhar Maharaj himself saw to Srila Govinda Maharaj's education, 
                and had him properly trained in Sanskrit and Bengali grammar and 
                literary composition, as well as the conclusions of the Shastras 
                (Vedic literatures). From the beginning, Srila Govinda Maharaj 
                demonstrated a remarkable memory and the ability to learn quickly 
                just by hearing. He has deep insight, and the ability to capture 
                even what is not apparent to others.</font></p>

                1941, Srila Sridhar Maharaj announced in Sanskrit verse that the 
                glories of the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math would be known throughout 
                the world. At that time, the "Math" was only a humble straw house. 
                It is Srila Govinda Maharaj who under the direction and supervision 
                of his Guru built and manifest the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math.</font></p>

                1986, Srila Sridhar Maharaj established Srila Govinda Maharaj 
                in his chair. Thus, more than two years before his departure from 
                this world, Srila Govinda Maharaj's spiritual master happily saw 
                the culmination of his desires and the culmination of his preparation 
                of Srila Govinda Maharaj as his successor. His vision for the 
                future manifest when he gave Srila Govinda Maharaj the responsibility

                that he is repeatedly travelling throughout the world just to 
                see how the prophecy of Srila Guru Maharaj (Srila Sridhar Maharaj)
