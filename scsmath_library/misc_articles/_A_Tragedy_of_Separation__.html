            Katwa to take <font color="#666666">sannyasa</font>, the renounced 
            order of life. After this, He would become known as Sri Chaitanya 
            Mahaprabhu. He swam across the Ganges and in wet cloth ran towards 
            Katwa. Just before this, He told only a few of His friends, including 
            Nityananda Prabhu, Gadadhara Pandit, Mukunda, and others, "The time

              few days before, an opposition party had been raised against Nimai 
              Pandit. Those who believed that material nature is the highest principle, 
              and that consciousness is a product of matter, began to abuse Nimai 
              Pandit. He thought, "I came to deliver the lowest of men, but if 
              they commit offenses against Me, there will be no hope for their 
              upliftment." </font>

              He said: "I came with that medicine which gives the greatest relief, 
              but now I find that their disease is rapidly growing worse and seems 
              beyond treatment. It will take its own course towards doom. The 
              patients are committing offenses by abusing their doctor. They are 
              making arrangements to insult Me. They take it that I am a family 
              man -- their nephew -- they take Me as one of them. I came with 
              the best medicine for the present degraded age, but now I find that 
              they are plotting against Me. Now they are doomed. At least I have 
              to show them that I am not one of them." He thought, "I shall leave 
              family life and take sannyasa and wander from village to village, 
              town to town, preaching the holy name of Krishna." That was His 
              decision, and within a few days He went to Katwa to take sannyasa 
              from Keshava Bharati Maharaj. </font>

              of Nimai Pandit. Every year in Bengal, that day was celebrated as 
              Lakshmi Puja, worship of the Goddess of Fortune, when special cakes 
              are prepared and distributed. Nimai, knowing that early the next 
              morning He would leave Nabadwip to take sannyasa, attracted His 
              followers in such a way that almost every leading devotee came to

            knew He was leaving; the ordinary devotees did not know that this 
            would be His last night in Nabadwip. With His own hands He garlanded 
            the necks of His devotees and appealed to them: "Always chant the

            Nama. And don't do anything else. While working, eating, sleeping 
            or waking, day or night -- in whatever you do -- continuously take 
            the name of Krishna. Always talk about Krishna -- nothing else. If 
            you have any real attraction or affection for Me, then don't do anything 
            without chanting the name of Krishna. Cultivate Krishna consciousness. 
            Krishna is the origin of us all. He is our father; we have come from 
            Him. The son who shows no gratitude towards the father is sure to 
            be punished birth after birth. Always chant these names of the Lord:

              this wonderful pumpkin. I can't resist." He said to Sachidevi: "Mother,

              sensing what was to come, was staying awake all night guarding the 
              door. Nimai bowed down to her and went away. And like a stone figure,

              made the people mad with the holy name of Krishna. He had released

              so much? Many big scholars came to conquer Nabadwip, the famous 
              seat of learning, and You have defeated them all. Are You that Nimai 
              Pandit?" "Yes," said Nimai. Keshava Bharati told Him, "I can give 
              You sannyasa, but You must take the permission of Your mother -- 
              otherwise I won't, I can't do it." Nimai suddenly began running 
              towards Nabadwip to ask permission, but Keshava Bharati thought, 
              "He has such a commanding personality, He can do anything." </font>

              It is impossible. If you do, then we shall smash your ahsram!" Sri

              in that post. Mahaprabhu took the garb of a Sannyasi from him for 
              His own purpose, to help His preaching activity. All these things 
              may be explained in different ways. In any case, after Mahaprabhu 
              took sannyasa, Keshava Bharati began to sing and dance with Sri
