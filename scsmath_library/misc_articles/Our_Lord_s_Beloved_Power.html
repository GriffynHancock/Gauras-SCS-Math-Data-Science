          <P align="justify"><em>Pranaya-vikrtir</em> - where Love Herself is taking form and
              playing with the Powerful, that is Srimati Radharani. Srila
              Swarup Damodar Prabhu has explained that Krishna's
              power is classified in three manifestations: first is <em>chit-sakti </em>(transcendental potency), the second is <em>jada-sakti</em> (mundane
              potency), and the third is where the first two come
              very close to each other, and that is called <em>tatastha-sakti</em>.
              First is light, second is shadow, and third is the position
              midway between the two. That is called tatastha. And from
              that third plane, the innumerable <em>jiva</em>-souls are manifest.</P>
          <P align="justify">Krishna, the Powerful, with these three powers in their
            fullness, is playing in the Paravyoma Dham. There, unlimited
            manifestations of the Lord are living, all within the
            infinite plane. And in Vrndavan, where Krishna's play is
            overflowing with love and affection, everything is for the
            satisfaction of the Powerful. There, love has five kinds of
            manifestation: <em>santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya </em>and <em>Madhura</em>.
            And <em>Madhura</em> is of two types: consorthood<em> (swakiya)</em> and
            paramour <em>(parakiya). </em>Where we see the supreme manifestation
            of <em>Madhura-rasa, </em>there we see the manifestation of Srimati 
              Radharani. She is <em>hladini-sakti, </em>and <em>hladini-sakti</em> is
            further explained in <em>Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta:</em></P>
          <P align="left"> <strong>krsnake ahlade, ta'te nama&mdash;&lsquo;hladini'<br>
              sei sakti-dvare sukha asvade apani<br>
          </strong>            <em>(Chaitanya-charitamrta: Madhya-lila, 8.157)</em></P>
          <P align="justify">"That power which is always supplying service for the
              satisfaction of Krishna, and through which comes full
              happiness, full joy and full ecstasy, that is called by the
              name <em>'hladini.'&quot;</em></P>
          <P align="justify">              In that realm everything is eternal and we cannot
              properly conceive that within our mundane intelligence.
              Therefore Sriman Mahaprabhu has said it is <em>achintya. </em>We
              have seen in the garden of one lady, a tree with three
              different types of fruit growing from it. Apricot, pear and
              plum, all growing on the same tree. I often use the
              example that if I ask a banana tree to please give me one
              mango, it will not be able to give that, not in this world.
              But after seeing that tree - actually two or three trees were
              there - I can say that it is possible, but still unbelievable.
              So if in this mundane world it is possible, then why not in 
              the transcendental world.</P>

          </blockquote>
          <P align="justify"> The explanation of Goloka Dham given in <em>Sri Brahma-samhita</em> is inconceivable from this plane, but it exists
              eternally and there all play is going on by the power of Srimati Radharani. She is always trying to satisfy Krishna in
  so many ways. Her form is most beautiful, and Krishna is
  also so nice and beautiful, and when they are playing
  together, the whole transcendental universe also plays
  through that mood of their love.</P>
          <P align="justify"> Here, is the shadow universe where <em>jada-sakti </em>is the
              power, and that power is also eternal. Still in the shadow
              we cannot clearly see everything. The shadow of my hand
              will not show the colour of my hand, and many other
              things are unmanifest in the shadow. That <em>jada-sakti</em> can
              also be divided into three: gross matter, subtle matter or
              the mental plane, and the ego or <em>ahankara. </em>These three
              cover the <em>jiva</em>-soul, so we are unable to perceive our real
            self.</P>
