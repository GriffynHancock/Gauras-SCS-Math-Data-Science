      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify">Today, Srila Govinda Maharaj 
        spoke about Govardhan Puja. Briefly, he told the beloved story and also 
        added drops of his nectar. He said that when it was time for the regular 
        Indra Puja, Krishna pointed out that Govardhan Hill is the actual supplier 
        of all the necessities of life, and asked why the cowherd men and women 
        were going to worship Indra instead. The gopas thought that Krishna seemed 
        to have some special mystic powers and so wanted to follow His advice. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Gurudev stretched his arms out wide, smiling hugely, to show how Govardhan 
        accepted all the offerings of the same ingredients previously meant for 
        King Indra.<br>
        <br>
        After Indra's retaliation of seven days of rain, King Indra investigated, 
        thinking all the inhabitants would be killed or gone. Surprised to see 
        that they were all still alive, he realised that Krishna is not ordinary 
        and offered his apologies. Krishna excused Indra from all offences, but 
        still Indra wanted to perform His abhisek. When Krishna was bathed in 
        the cows' milk, He became known as Govinda, and the milk, as Govinda Kunda.<br>
        <br>
        Srila Gurudev also told about a pilgrimage by Srila Guru Maharaj, Srila 
        B.R. Sridhar Maharaj, to Govardhan, around 1940. Following the example 
        of Sri Raghunath Das Goswami, who worshipped the Govardhan sila given 
        to him by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, &nbsp;Guru Maharaj took two or three 
        silas from Govardhan and thus established Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math 
        by worshipping Them.<br>
        <br>
        Then Gurudev told us about the instruction to arrange Sri Govinda Kunda 
        in Nabadwip Dham. Soon after coming to the mission, Srila Guru Maharaj 
        gave him some practical work by saying, &quot;In front of our Math is 
        Govinda Kunda; this area is Gupta Govardhan. If you can, arrange some 
        decoration for finishing and make a small temple in the middle for Mahaprabhu's 
        playing.&quot; That is now manifest, Gurudev says, &quot;by the mercy 
        of Guru Maharaj.&quot; He said that it is aparadha-bhanjan-pata; anyone 
        who has committed offence can surrender there and touch that water, and 
        the offence will go out. Adding to his pleasure, Sripad Goswami Maharaj 
        reiterated part of the sloka inaugurating Govinda Kunda: occasionally, 
        those swimming in Govinda Kunda may taste a bit of the water as milk.<br>
