If you read the final lesson before reading the earlier               lessons, that can sometimes be very harmful to digest. Only after               reading the first three lessons, can you read [and understand] the               fourth lesson. </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>B</b>ut               by the time the Western devotees came to Srila Guru Maharaj, he               could not wait, and therefore he expressed his fourth lesson. For               example, he expressed the explanation of the Gayatri Mantram --               <font color="#666666">gayatry artha viniryyasam gita gudhartha gauravam</font>               -- which previously no one had done widely. Srila Guru Maharaj's               conception is very high, and he gave that Gayatri explanation in               the last chapter of his life. But it is also necessary to know his               previous presentation. We can receive that from his book <font color="#666666">Sri               Sri Prapanna Jivanamrtam</font>. We must take this scripture into               our hearts and then we shall be able to understand the other things.               The first stage for us has been given by Srila Guru Maharaj there.               </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>E</b>verything               is there, including the very highest things, but mainly there is               one theme: saranagati, or surrender. The first thing is saranagati.               The fully surrendered soul can understand everything, and this is               shown in <font color="#666666">Sri Sri Prapanna Jivanamrtam</font>               along with many examples. If we can think in that way, and try to               proceed in that way, then no problems will come to us. In the middle               stage is Srila Guru Maharaj's <font color="#666666">Srimad Bhagavad               Gita</font> explanation. There are some sections in particular,               where Srila Guru Maharaj gave high explanations; especially worth               mentioning are verses 9:30-31 and 10:9-10. And in his last manifest               Pastimes Srila Guru Maharaj gave, amongst other things, his <font color="#666666">Rig               Mantram</font> explanation of Gayatri. </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>S</b>rila               Guru Maharaj expressed to me, "<a href="saraswati_thakur.html">Srila               Bhakti Siddhanta</a> Saraswati Prabhupad gave me the property and               Nityananda Prabhu ordered me: 'You must try to give this to others,'               therefore lastly I am trying to do so. Also others including Candidas,               Vidyapati, and Narottama Thakur expressed some high conceptions.               Who is able to understand shall understand it in future, but what               I have I want to express now." That was Srila Guru Maharaj's desire               and in that way he gave such high conceptions. But if someone tries               to read the fourth lesson without first reading from the beginning               the first, second, and third lessons, then that will be very difficult               -- and that can also be harmful. </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>W</b>hen               I tried, by the order of Srila Guru Maharaj, to read the <font color="#666666">Harinamamrta               Vyakarana</font> in order to learn Sanskrit, there was one book,               <font color="#666666">Amarakosa</font>, the meaning of which I could               not understand. Nobody can understand its meaning at first because               it is only a book of words, a selection of words. It lists the main               names of Vishnu, of Indra, and so many main alternative names of               others. Everything in heaven has so many names, not just a single               name, and Srila Guru Maharaj instructed me, "You must memorize it               otherwise you will not be able to read or write Sanskrit, because               you will not be able to understand its meaning." To only memorize               names without any meanings is very hard for me, but those first               lessons are necessary. Recently I saw that book and was reminded               of this. </font>           </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Read             this book and you will get everything</b> </font></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td width="20">&nbsp;</td>          <td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>T</b>herefore             it is necessary to complete the first lesson, the second lesson, and             the third lesson -- then it is possible to understand the fourth lesson.             Srila Guru Maharaj gave those first three lessons in <font color="#666666">Sri             Sri Prapanna Jivanamrtam</font>, as well as the fourth lesson.

Therefore               we must take shelter at the lotus feet of Krishna. Service to Krishna               can give us everything, and this type of faith is called saranagati.               If you can memorize just one <font color="#666666">sloka</font>,               or verse, and put that in your heart, then from this one sloka you               will get everything ever given in any scripture. </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I</b>               tried before to know, in one sentence, what is saranagati. We know               that saranagati is surrender, but that is not sufficient. Therefore               I asked Srila Guru Maharaj. He replied, "Have you not read <font color="#666666">Prapanna               Jivanamrtam</font>?" </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I</b>               said, "Yes Maharaj, I have, but is the explanation there?"

In <font color="#666666">Prapanna Jivanamrtam</font>               this is explained and in each case there are examples and expressions               of the feelings of other devotees. If you read this book you can               understand. There Srila Guru Maharaj explains the subject very clearly               and very nicely. Saranagati is the first thing -- and saranagati               is the last thing. If you want to enter into transcendental knowledge               you must first take shelter of saranagati.

On reading <a href="bhaktivinod_thakur.html">Srila               Bhaktivinoda Thakur</a>'s book <font color="#666666">Saranagati</font>,               this point impressed me most. He wrote: </font>             <blockquote>               <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>                 sad anga saranagati haibe yanhara<br>                &nbsp;&nbsp; tanhara prarthana sune sri nanda-kumara</b> </font>             </blockquote>            <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<b>I</b>f             you want Nanda Kumar, you must have this six-fold saranagati." [The             six limbs of saranagati are: acceptance of the favorable; rejection             of the unfavorable; full confidence in the Lord's protection; embracing             the Lord's guardianship; full self-surrender; and surrender in humility.]             </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I</b>               wanted to culture that, so at that time, after coming to live alone               I recollected all I had imbibed in my Math life, and also consulted               about saranagati in <font color="#666666">Hari Bhakti Vilasa</font>,               in Srila Jiva Goswami's <font color="#666666">Bhakti Sandarbha</font>,               and in the Ramanuja Sampradaya's writings. I then tried to collect               it all together and arrange it in a particular way as I thought               best. In this way I began to write the book <font color="#666666">Sri               Sri Prapanna Jivanamrtam</font>, that it may also help others who               might come in such a position as mine. That was the real reason.               </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>T</b>he               title <font color="#666666">Sri Sri Prapanna Jivanamrtam</font>               means, <font color="#666666">prapannanam, jivane, amrta-svarupam</font>:               "The nectar in the life of the surrendered souls." This was my conception               from the beginning: <font color="#666666">prapanna-jivanamrta</font>.               Those who have come to take this, to feel it, this will be like               nectar to them. To those who have surrendered, it will be nectar               to them, but others, the ordinary people, may not appreciate it.               </font>             <p>&nbsp;           </td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td colspan="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Nectar             in the life of the surrendered souls</b> </font></td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td>&nbsp;</td>          <td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I</b>t             will be the nectar in the life of those who have surrendered, those             who have the real <font color="#666666">adhikara</font>, or the proper             qualified standard of faith to receive it. Srila Jiva Goswami wrote,             "Those who have faith in the Veda, in <font color="#666666">Srimad             Bhagavatam</font> and such things, they are to read this book; otherwise,             I put a curse, that those who do not have such faith should not come             to read my book." Jiva Goswami has written in such a way: "You unbelievers             won't come to touch my book. You who are unbelievers, it is not meant             for you! It is only for those who have faith in such things. Others             are discarded. You -- the ordinary public -- are discarded. You must             not touch my book because you will misunderstand it." </font>             <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>T</b>his               is also a custom of proper behavior. If one ventures to read such               things, at least he must approach with some caution, and not with               the mood of curiosity, "Oh, why does he say this?" for that will               be dangerous. So, <font color="#666666">adhikari nirnaya</font>.               Whoever will come to read the Veda, if he has not attained the standard,               he will misunderstand, or mutilate it. <font color="#666666">Paroksa-vado               vedo 'yam / balanam anusasanam</font> [<font color="#666666">Srimad               Bhagavatam</font> - 11:3:44].
