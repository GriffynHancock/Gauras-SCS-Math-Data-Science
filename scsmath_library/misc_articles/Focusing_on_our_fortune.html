              is happiness eluding us? Because we are never satisfied. No matter 
              how much we get, we always hanker for more. Such is the nature of 
              every one of us in all fields and walks of life. How then could 
              finite material objects and flickering bodily or intellectual pleasures 
              satiate our infinite hankerings?<br>
              For as long as we go on searching for happiness within the material 
              plane, our efforts and endeavours are destined to be irrevocably 
              frustrated. Due to their natural limitations, material objects and 
              goals simply cannot satisfy our limitless hankerings. Only by seeking 
              out the beauty and love of the unlimited spiritual realm can we 
              hope to be successful in our common quest for lasting happiness.</font>

          <td><div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Lord is always 
            there, even in the worst period of our lives. He is waiting, waiting 
            to help us. We must only look up for His grace, with sincerity with 
            all sincerity. He is everywhere, waiting; &quot;My boy, look at Me. 
            Don't make much of the external environment. I am here, very near 
            to you. You have cast your focus aside, you have cast your consciousness 
            outside. Make it internal and you will find Me here. Make it above. 
            You are looking down to secure servants and comforts, but if you look 
            up, for existence higher than you, you will find Me in that plane. 
            Look up! Don't look down, searching for servants.&quot;<br>
            You want to become a master and thus are searching for servants, hunting 
            after things for your service. Take the opposite course, become a 
            servant and search for your master, your Lord, then you will be uplifted, 
            taken up to a higher domain. If you want to live in a higher domain 
            you will have to serve. If you want to be a master, then you will 
            have to come down in the lower zone, where you can be a master.<br>
            This is neither exaggeration nor imagination, it is something scientific. 
            You can enjoy only those that are of a lower position. So, by attempting 
            to enjoy, mean association becomes inevitable. Only by preparing for 
            higher service will you be able to come in contact with your soul's 
            higher position.<br>
            Sacrificeby sacrifice you go up; by enjoying spirit you will have 
            to go down. We are to understand what is exploitation and enjoyment, 
            and what is higher service. Divine service is pure, and in that service 
            there is also a pure type of joy and ecstasy. By giving we become 
            gainers and by extorting we become losers. This scientific truth should 
            be understood. </font></div></td>

            <div align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
              robbing things from others, someone can find superficial satisfaction, 
              but underground there is some suspicion that the result won't be 
              very good: &quot;The reaction will come to attack me.&quot; To exploit 
              by stealing provides some sort of enjoyment, but happiness is also 
              enjoyed by big donors through their giving in chariy. There is a 
              difference in quality between these two sorts of happiness, and 
              we are to distinguish between them.<br>
              In different planes there are different conceptions of happiness, 
              and a comparison is to be drawn between the qualitative differences 
              in the pleasure derived. We are to conceive of different planes 
              of life. The life of higher service is divine life. The Absolute 
              God is there. Everything is for Him. Everything here is for His 
              pleasure.<br>
              But, in which way can we attain divine life? What is mundane? And 
              what is divine? We are to differentiate between them. We have to 
              examine them in order to accept the divine life.<br>
              What is God? God is not an order supplier. If I am sick, I am not 
              to just ask, &quot;Oh God, cure my sickness!&quot; And if I am poor, 
              I should not only pray, &quot;Oh God, give me money!&quot; Such 
              mercenary connection is not very happy, but still it has some meaning 
              because at least there is thought that there is some supernatural 
              power and that He can do wonders. However, it is better to want 
              God without expecting anything mundane from Him. We should want 
              God who is the source of all this opulence the reservoir of all 
              rasa, love, beauty, charm, affection, ecstasy and eternal fulfilment 
              and we should not want anything else which we consider valuable. 
              We are to depend on Him: &quot;Oh Lord, give me what is good. I 
              am an imperfect being, I do not know what is good and and what is 
              bad. Please provide whatever You consider to be good for me.&quot; 
              This is an improvement over praying to Him for mundane benefits.<br>
              But best is to accept the creed of unalloyed service to the Highest: 
              &quot;I want You, my Lord, nothing else.&quot; And what will be 
              our connection with Him? Service. &quot;I want only Your service.&quot;<br>
              At the beginning we might think we are being losers, but ultimately 
              we will gain. Apparently we are giving ourselves, we are sacrificing 
              our selfish interests, but in the subtle senses we gain thereby. 
              This ontological truth should be appreciated. It is neither a dogma, 
              nor blind faith. It is based on higher unprejudiced reasons. </font>

              fulfilment? To do that we are to search for God. We must search
