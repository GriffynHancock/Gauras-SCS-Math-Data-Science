              <p>In <i>Sri Bhakti Raksak Divya-vani: Sermons of the Guardian of 
                Devotion,</i> His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami 
                Maharaj explains that when Mahaprabhu went to Advaita-bhavan, 
                Sri Advaita Acharyya's home in Santipur, after taking sannyas, 
                Raghunath Das Goswami came seeking His lotus feet. When he saw 
                Lord Gaurahari - the Lord of his heart - he became mad with 
                love of Krishna. Srila Guru Maharaj says that Sripad Raghunath 
                Das was the son of a wealthy landowner but &quot;his heart was 
                completely melted by Mahaprabhu's beauty and charming personality, 
                His devotion and His teachings of devotion for Krishna.&quot; 
                Mahaprabhu Himself knew the heart of Sripad Raghunath Das Goswami. 
                Raghunath Das would not leave the divine lotus feet of Mahaprabhu, 
                but the Lord told him, &quot;Go home. Don't be over-enthusiastic; 
                control yourself. Keep your Divine love for Krishna within your 
                heart, and don't express it outwardly. Don't advertise 
                it. Very soon the time will come when Krishna will guide you. 
                He will make a way for you. Don't allow any external show 
                but keep it within your heart.&quot;</p>

              <p>Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami narrates how inwardly, Sri Raghunath 
                Das was completely renounced, even in family life, but he kept 
                his renunciation hidden and pleased his parents by acting like 
                an ordinary business man. In his heart, he was always feeling 
                the burning pain of separation from his Lord. After one year, 
                he tried to run to the shelter of Sriman Mahaprabhu but his father 
                caught him in a distant place and brought him back. Almost daily 
                Raghunath Das would run away from home. His father, or his father's 
                men, would bring him back. His mother complained, &quot;Our son 
                has become mad. Just somehow keep him by binding him with ropes.&quot; 
                But his father said, &quot;Our son, Raghunath, has opulence like 
                Indra, the heavenly King, and his wife is as beautiful as an angel. 
                Yet these things cannot tie his mind down. How then can mere ropes 
                bind him? Who can keep home such a madman of Chaitanyachandra.&quot; 
              </p>
              <p align="left"> <b>&quot;Make a Festival&quot;</b></p>
              <p>The next day Sri Raghunath Das went to receive the darshan of 
                Sriman Nityananda in the village of Panihati in West Bengal. Lord 
                Nityananda was sitting on a rock under a tree by the bank of the 
                Ganges. The Lord appeared as effulgent as hundreds and thousands 
                of rising suns. Many devotees sat, surrounding Him like rays of 
                sunlight. Seeing the divine influence of Lord Nityananda, Raghunath 
                Das was overcome with spiritual emotion. Due to his extreme humility, 
                he offered his dandavat pranam from a distance. But the servant 
                of Nityananda Prabhu saw him and called out to the Lord, &quot;There 
                is Raghunath Das, offering You obeisances.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                <img src="panihati-2.jpg" width="240" height="184" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4" border="1">Hearing 
                this, Lord Nitai said, &quot;You are a thief. Now you have come 
                to see Me. Come here, come here. Today, I shall punish you!&quot; 
                The Lord called to him, but Raghunath Das did not approach the 
                Lord. The Lord forcibly caught him and placed His lotus feet upon 
                Raghunath's head. Nityananda Prabhu is by nature very playful. 
                He is also an ocean of sweet mercy. He said to Raghunath, &quot;You 
                are just like a thief! Instead of coming near, you stay away at 
                a distant place. Now that I have captured you, I shall punish 
                you.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                Lord Nityananda said to Raghunath, &quot;Make a festival and feed 
                all my associates yogurt and chipped rice.&quot; Hearing the instruction 
                of Sri Dayal Nitai, Raghunath Das became very blissful. He immediately 
                sent his own men to the village to purchase all kinds of eatables 
                and bring them back. Raghunath brought chipped, or flat rice, 
                yogurt, milk, sweetmeats, sugar, bananas and other delicious foods 
                and placed them all around. As soon as they heard that there would 
                be a festival, many brahmanas and other gentlemen began to arrive. 
                Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami notes that there were innumerable 
                people - so many that one was unable to count them. And the crowd 
                continued to increase. <br>
                <br>
                Sri Raghunath Das arranged to get more and more foodstuffs from 
                neighbouring villages and he bought several hundred large, round 
                earthen pots. In the larger pots a brahmana began soaking chipped 
                rice for the satisfaction of Lord Nityananda. Some of the rice 
                was mixed with yogurt and some was mixed with condensed milk. 
                Then sugar, ghee, camphor and a special type of banana known as 
                <i>champa-kala</i> were added.<br>
                <br>
                Nityananda Prabhu sat on a raised platform under a large banyan 
                tree. The most important and intimate associates of the Lord, 
                as well as other important men, sat in a circle on the platform 
                around the Lord. Many more learned scholars, brahmanas and priests 
                arrived. Lord Nityananda honoured them all and made them sit with 
                Him on the raised platform. Everyone was offered two earthen pots. 
                In one was the flat rice with condensed milk and in the other 
                was the flat rice with yoghurt.<br>
                <br>
                When there was no more room on the platform, many of the brahmanas 
                went to the bank of the Ganges with their two pots of flat rice. 
                Others, who could not find a place even on the bank, went into 
                the pure water of the Ganges and began eating from their pots 
                of rice. Raghava Pandit arrived and began to laugh with great 
                surprise and amusement at the scene before him. Lord Nityananda 
                made Raghava Pandit sit down to eat from two pots and said, &quot;I 
                belong to a community of cowherd boys, and therefore I generally 
                have many cowherd associates with Me. I am happy when we eat together 
                in a picnic like this by the sandy bank of the river.&quot;</p>
              <p align="left"><b>Like the Whorl of a Lotus Flower</b></p>
              <p><img src="panihati-1.jpg" width="240" height="259" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4" border="1">When 
                the chipped rice had been brought to everyone, Sriman Nityananda, 
                in meditation, brought Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. When Mahaprabhu 
                arrived, He and Nityananda Prabhu walked through all the groups 
                of eaters and observed how everyone was enjoying the flat rice 
                with yoghurt and condensed milk. From each and every pot, Lord 
                Nityananda took one morsel of chipped rice and pushed it into 
                the mouth of Mahaprabhu as a joke. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, also 
                smiling, took a morsel of food, pushed it into the mouth of Nityananda 
                and laughed as He made Him eat it. All the Vaisnavas stood to 
                see the playful mood of Lord Nityananda, but because they were 
                unable to see Mahaprabhu, they could not understand his actions. 
                Only a few devotees who were very fortunate were able to see the 
                divine form of Mahaprabhu.<br>
                <br>
                The two Lords sat and honoured the flat rice. Seeing Lord Chaitanya 
                Mahaprabhu beside Him eating, Nityananda Prabhu became very happy 
                and exhibited varieties of ecstatic love. In <i>Sri Chaitanya 
                Bhagavat,</i> Srila Vrindavan Das Thakur said that he is unable 
                to describe the unlimited ecstatic love of Lord Nityananda. He 
                is always chanting just one Name, &quot;Sri Krishna Chaitanya,&quot; 
                no other Name escaped His lips even in dream. Lord Nitai is fully 
                surrendered in His love for Lord Chaitanya.<br>
                <br>
                To the crowd of devotees He ordered, &quot;All of you eat, chanting 
                the Holy Name of 'Hari.'&quot; Immediately the Holy Names &quot;Hari, 
                Hari&quot; resounded, filling the entire universe. When all the 
                Vaisnavas were chanting the Names of the Lord and taking prasadam, 
                they were remembering how Krishna and Balaram ate with Their companions 
                on the bank of the Yamuna. &quot;Like the whorl of a lotus flower 
                surrounded by its petals and leaves. Krishna sat in the centre, 
                encircled by lines of His friends, who all looked very beautiful. 
                Every one of them was trying to look forward toward Krishna, thinking 
                that Krishna might look toward him. In this way they enjoyed their 
                lunch in the forest.&quot; <i>(Bhag10.13.8.)</i> The confidential 
                devotees of the Lord who were cowherd boys actually felt the bank 
                of the Ganga to now be the bank of the Yamuna. Sri Raghunath Das 
                observed all these activities and felt his heart overfow with 
                the gracious and liberal mercy of Sri Sri Nitai Chaitanyadev.<br>
                <br>
                Still more and more food arrived. Sri Raghunath Das purchased 
                it all and offered it to Nityananda Prabhu and the devotees. Others 
                were offering garlands, sandalwood and betel nuts to the Lord. 
                With His own hands Lord Nityananda distributed all the remnants. 
                Raghunath Das, feeling great happiness, gave the remnants to his 
                associates then took a little for himself.</p>
              <p align="left"><b>Inundated in Ecstatic Love</b></p>
              <p>After resting, Lord Nitai went to the home and temple of Sri 
                Raghava Pandit and began kirttan. He inspired all the devotees 
                to dance and then He Himself began dancing. Srila Krishna Das 
                Kaviraj Goswami says that the entire world was inundated in ecstatic 
                love. The dancing of Nityananda Prabhu cannot be compared to anything 
                within these three worlds. No one can describe the sweetness of 
                such dancing. Only Lord Nitai could see that Lord Gaurasundar 
                Himself came to observe this dancing. Lord Nityananda danced with 
                such ecstatic abandon that the earth reeled under His feet and 
                roaring sounds like thunder came from His lotus mouth. His movements 
                were like flashes of lightning, yet at the same time, they were 
                graceful, charming and delicate. When His merciful glance fell 
                on any person, he was instantaneously infused with Divine Love 
                of Godhead.<br>
                <br>
                It is said that Srimati Radharani Herself cooks in the house of 
                Sri Raghava Pandit. She received the benediction from Durvasa 
                Muni that whatever She cooked would be sweeter than nectar. That 
                is the special feature of Her cooking. Following kirttan, the 
                Lord and all the devotees ate the sumptuous prasadam with great 
                satisfaction. All the devotees present requested Sri Raghunath 
                Das to sit and take prasadam, but Raghava Pandit told them, &quot;He 
                will take later.&quot;</p>
              <p align="left"><b>&quot;Lord Gaurahari came here Personally to

              <p>In the morning, Nityananda Prabhu sat with His associates under 
                the same tree by the bank of the Ganges. Raghunath Das went there 
                to worship His <b>l</b>otus feet. Through Raghava Pandit, he prayed:</p>
            </div>
            <blockquote> 
              <div align="left"><b>&quot;adhama, pamara mui hina jivadhama!<br>
                mora ichcha haya - pana chaitanya-charana&quot;</b><br>
                <br>
                <i>&quot;I am the lowest of men, the most sinful, fallen and condemned. 
                Nevertheless, I desire to attain the shelter of Sri Chaitanya 
                Mahaprabhu.&quot;</i></div>
            </blockquote>
            <div align="justify"> 
              <p>Raghunath Das continued by saying that he is like a dwarf who 
                wants to catch the moon. Every time he has tried to run to catch 
                Mahaprabhu's lotus feet, he has been captured and returned 
                to family life. Giving us his pure example, Raghunath Das prays 
                to Sriman Nityananda for the shelter of Mahaprabhu.<br>
                <br>
                Lord Nitai was very pleased by the humility and sincere prayers 
                of Raghunath. He told the devotees that although Raghunath was 
                situated in such opulent material happiness, he doesn't care 
                for it at all. The Lord called Raghunath Das near to Him and placed 
                His divine feet upon His head. &quot;My dear Raghunath Das,&quot; 
                He said with affection, &quot;since you arranged the feast on 
                the bank of the Ganges, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came here just 
                to show you His mercy. By His mercy He ate the flat rice and milk. 
                Then, after seeing the dancing of the devotees at night, He took 
                His supper. Lord Gaurahari came here personally to deliver you. 
                Now rest assured that all the impediments meant for your bondage 
                are gone.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                The Lord told him that very soon he would attain the shelter of 
                Mahaprabhu and become one of His most confidential servants under 
                the charge of Sri Svarup Damodar. Lord Nityananda had Raghunath 
                blessed by all the devotees and Raghunath Das offered his dandavat 
                pranams to their lotus feet. Afterwards, with great devotion and 
                humility, Sri Raghunath Das gave gold coins to Raghava Pandit 
                saying, &quot;I want to give money just to worship the lotus feet 
                of all the great devotees, servants and subservants of Lord Nityananda.&quot; 
                He also secretly gave one hundred gold coins and about seven tolas 
                of gold for Lord Nitai. Raghunath Das left for home with a heart 
                full of devotion. Desire realised is a sweetness to the soul. 
                His mind was peaceful and happy because he knew that he had received 
                the merciful benediction of Nityananda Prabhu and soon he would 
                find his heart's treasure at the lotus feet of his Lord Gaurahari 
                in Sridham Puri.<br>

                Sometimes a tiny glimpse of a Vaisnava's sincere humility 
                will cause one's heart to break.<br>
                <br>
                Srila Guru Maharaj said that Srila Raghunath Das Goswami is considered 
                to be our <i>Prayojanacharyya,</i> the guide to show us the highest 
                fulfilment of life:<i> Radha-dasyam.</i> All the Vaisnavas give 
                honour and praise to Srila Raghunath Das Goswami whose qualities 
                are too numerous to list here. When Mahaprabhu told Raghunath 
                Das that the mercy of Krishna is stronger than anything and had 
                delivered him from the ditch of materialistic life, Sri Raghunath 
                Das Goswami prayed:</p>
