      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deep in the forest of 
      Mount Neela there was a legendary Deity of Sri Neela Madhab that was worshiped 
      by a tribal chief named Viswavasu. Viswavasu never allowed anyone to know 
      the location of this vigraha that was said to have the blinding brightness 
      of a blue jewel. The news of this mysterious Deity made its way to a great 
      king of the time named Indradyumna who then very much wanted to worship 
      this Deity and take darshan. So he sent a Brahmin priest by the name of 
      Vidyapati to locate the Deity, but after many attempts he failed to locate 
      the site of Neela Mandhab. </font> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eventually 
        the Brahmin Vidyapati managed to marry the tribal chief&#146;s daughter 
        whose name was Lalita. Now being a member of the family Vidyapati repeatedly 
        asked his father-in-law to take him to have darshan of this sublime form 
        of the Lord. Finally Viswavasu conceded to take him blindfolded so as 
        not to reveal the way. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vidyapati 
        remembering King Indradyumna&#146;s request cleverly dropped mustard seeds 
        along the way. Later Vidyapati, following the sprouted mustard seeds finally 
        found the location of the vigraha, and informed king Indradyumna of the 
        whereabouts of Neela Madhab. Consequently the king made his way to the 
        site, but to his great disappointment it had been hidden in the sand. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Determined 
        to take darshan the King commenced a fatal fast until death. Whereupon 
        after some time he heard a celestial voice cry out &quot;you shall see 
        Him.&quot; The king then performed a great horse sacrifice and built a 
        glorious Temple for the Lord Vishnu in which Narada installed a murti 
        of Nrsimha. Later in the king&#146;s sleep he had a divine vision where 
        the Lord instructed him to go to the seashore of Puri to find a sacred 
        log that was to be carved and installed as Lord Jagannath, Balabadra and 
        Subhadra.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Srila 
        Govinda Maharaj also quoted in relation to this article, the first verse 
        of Sri Bramha Samhita:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;&#9;<b>isvarah 
        paramah krsnah saccidananda vigrahah</b></font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        anadir adir govindah sarvva-karana-karanam</font></b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Translation:</b>&#9;<i>The 
        Supreme Lord, the embodiment of Truth, Consciousness and Joy, is Govinda 
        Krishna. He is beginningless, the origin of all that be, and the cause 
        of all causes.</i></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lord 
        Jagannath is none other than Sri Krsna himself. Jagannath or Jagarnaut 
        means &#145;universal&#146; and as Krishna states Himself all through 
        chapter ten of Sri Bhagavad-gita: &quot;My expansions are innumerable.&quot; 
        Therefore Sri Jagannath is not just another form of Sri Visnu but is the 
        absolute all-encompassing form of Sri Krishna.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jai 
        Jagannath, Jai Gurudev!</font></p>
