As was predicted in the scriptures for<I> kali-yuga</I>,           people only know about ritualistic ceremonies. They stay up the whole           night singing the glories of some demigod. Some of them proudly worship           Visahari, who removes the effect of snake poison. Others set up idols           and worship them with great wealth. They spend money lavishly on their           sons and daughters. Like this, everyone simply wastes their time. They           never care to engage in Krsna-<I>kirttan</I> which is the <I>yuga-dharmma</I>,           our only religious practice for this age. They prefer to speak ill of           others rather than say good things about them. Even from those who are           puffed up with their detachment and renunciation, we never hear the           chanting of the Holy Names from their lips. Some others think that the           time of bathing is the only auspicious moment for chanting the names           'Govinda' and 'Pundarikaksa.' Those who recite the <I>Bhagavatam</I>           for the education of the people, do not have the devotional serving           mood in their tongue. Thus the Lord's energy produces the worldly illusion.           This causes the devotee's unhappiness to increase without limit. Seeing           the whole world devoid of Krsna<i>-bhakti</i> their hearts are burning           within. Some of them feel such intense pain that they want to leave           their bodies. Others simply sigh and produce the Name 'Krsna' in their           exhaling. Their food no longer tastes good in their mouths. When they           see the activities of this material world they become exceedingly unhappy.&quot;           </FONT></P>        <P align=justify><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"         size=4>Advaita Acharyya was glorified by everyone, even among the society           of non-devotees, as He was representative of all the Vaisnavas.

And Sita Devi's position           was like Mahadevi. Vrindavan Das Thakur explained that Sita Devi served           Sriman Mahaprabhu in her house many times and came to Mahaprabhu's house           many times to meet with Sachi Mata and Mahaprabhu. At the time when           Mahaprabhu took sannyas, by the will of Nityananda Prabhu, he went to           Advaita Acharya's house. Sita Devi made all the cooking arrangements           and was feeding the Vaisnavas. Advaita Acharya was a wealthy Vaisnava.           Not poor. Naturally Vaisnavas are poor like Srivas Pandit, but Advaita           Acharya was wealthy. Everyone respected Him. Even Hiranya Govardan,           Raghunath Das Goswami Prabhu's father, every year gave some offerings           to Advaita Acharya. </FONT></P>        <P align=justify><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"         size=4>One day Advaita Acharya made some duplicity. He was thinking Mahaprabhu           was always respecting Him, and He could not give proper respect to Mahaprabhu           as His heart wanted. Mahaprabhu came to his house and saw him explaining           the philosophy of Sankaracharya. Mahaprabhu could not tolerate it and           tried to beat him. Beating and beating. Sita Devi said, "No more beating.           This Brahmin will die." And Advaita Acharya was very happy. "You are           always giving respect to me.
