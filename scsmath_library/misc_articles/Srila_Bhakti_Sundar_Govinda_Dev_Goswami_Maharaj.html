      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
        is favourable for the practitioner's life, we shall take that happily, 
        and what is non-favourable, we must leave that. Most favourable is:<i> 
        suddha-bhakata-charana-renu, bhajana-anukula.</i></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
        always try to take the dust of the lotus feet of the devotee who is a 
        real devotee of Krishna. If we take shelter of him, and if we follow his 
        guidances, we must be benefited. And it is said, that 'I am your servant, 
        please give me instruction and service to Krishna under guidance of you.' 
        <i>Suddha-bhakata-charana-renu, bhajana-anukula. </i>That is the most 
        favourite of the practising devotees. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And: 
        <i>bhakata-seva, parama-siddhi, prema-latikara mula. </i>That is, Krishna 
        will be happy if we serve the devotee of Krishna. All the transcendental 
        benefit we will get through the service of the devotee. <i>Bhakata-seva, 
        parama-siddhi &#150;</i> means<i> </i>extreme benefit we will get through 
        the service of the devotee of Krishna. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And: 
        <i>prema-latikara mula. </i>That means if we can satisfy the devotee, 
        Krishna will be merciful to me and Krishna will bestow His mercy upon 
        my head; and I will get the affectionate service of Krishna, also service 
        mood of Krishna more exclusively, and that is Krishna-<i>prema.</i> That 
        also I may get, through the service of the devotee. This is first. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second: 
        <i>Madhava-tithi, bhakti-janani, jatane palana kori. Madhava tithi. "</i>Madhava,<i>" 
        </i>this word. <i>Ma </i>means Laksmi Devi, <i>dhava </i>means the husband, 
        that is Narayana. Another way that we can express it is, <i>Ma </i>means 
        Radharani and <i>dhava </i>is paramour lover: Krishna. Then what is dear 
        to Krishna, that <i>tithi,</i> that lunar date, if we worship Krishna 
        on that day, Krishna will be more happy. In this way, Ekadasi, Janmastami, 
        Radhastami, the Appearance Day of Mahaprabhu, the Appearance Day of Nityananda 
        Prabhu, the Appearance Day of Adwaita Prabhu, Rupa, Sanatana, Svarupa 
        Damodar, all these <i>tithi</i> are called <i>Madhava tithi,</i> that 
        is, dear to Krishna.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
        can remember one thing, and that day I was very surprised. We were very 
        sad, extremely sad that day when Guru Maharaj disappeared, 12th August 
        1988. But when Guru Maharaj disappeared, before that we have seen many 
        symptoms in this Earth. An earthquake came, a very heavy earthquake, heavier 
        than I have seen in my life of sixty years. And many other symptoms came, 
        very suddenly! After seeing them I told my Godbrothers, "Now Guru Maharaj 
        must leave this world, and within three to four days this will happen. 
        And after leaving this world, also within three to four days again this 
        type of symptom will come in this Earth."</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 
        is, Guru Maharaj is a great devotee of Krishna, and when he leaves this 
        mundane world, really, the jewel of the garland must fall down, like a 
        star from the sky. Then some disturbance and symptoms must come again. 
        And it happened.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
        we were arranging the <i>samadhi</i> of Guru Maharaj, Sripad Sagar Maharaj 
        was there. When I came to the Deities for paying dandavats and I stood 
        to see the Deities' faces; very effulgent, very glorified, extremely glorified 
        and very effulgent, and smiling like man, eyes like man's eyes especially 
        Radharani and Krishna and Mahaprabhu. It was beyond my thinking, and I 
        could not understand why on this day the Deities were very happy and They 
        cannot hide Their heart's expression. And after seeing that I thought 
        that Guru Maharaj has joined his <i>Nitya-lila,</i> eternal Pastimes of 
        Krishna, Radharani and Mahaprabhu, and this symptom coming out from the 
        form of our Deities. My heart was very sad, but looking at the form of 
        the Deities I was stunned and I could not imagine that form, and I could 
        feel some peace in my mind. Oh, Guru Maharaj was with us and the Deities 
        were suffering because of that, and now Guru Maharaj has gone to join 
        the Pastimes of Radha-Krishna and Mahaprabhu, and They are happy.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
        need that and we shall try to make the Deities happy. And like a man, 
        but it is very effulgent, I cannot speak it, never have I seen in my whole 
        life such beauty in the Deities.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
        is <i>Madhava tithi.</i> When Krishna, Radharani, and His associates are 
        appearing in this mundane world, and when disappearing, all these days 
        are very auspicious for the devotee &#150; that is called <i>Madhava tithi.</i> 
        That is, Madhava is getting the happiness. That day we must try in a more 
        glorifying way to give our service to our Lordship and with great care 
        we shall try to give honour to that date.</font></p>
