              unwanted lusty desires of our hearts are foreign things. They are 
              only mushrooms. Like mushrooms, they come out; they have no permanent 
              stability or root. They are not rooted to the soil. We may think 
              that what we have stored in our hearts is very near and dear, and 
              that is already mixed with us as a part of our existence, but when 
              Krishna consciousness enters, they will all float like mushrooms.

              all, they are mushrooms; they have no footing, no connection with 
              the soil. They are only floating. All material interests are only 
              floating on the surface. They are not deeply rooted within and without 
              the whole of our existence. Only Krishna consciousness has its existence 
              everywhere, within all parts of our existence. So, the mushrooms 
              will have to vanish one day. This is confirmed in the <font color="#666666">Srimad

            Krishna enters the heart through the ear, He captures the lotus of 
            the heart and then gradually makes all the dirt in the heart disappear. 
            Just as when the autumn season comes, all the water everywhere becomes 
            pure, so also, when Krishna enters our hearts, all the impurities 
            within will gradually vanish, and only Krishna will remain forever.
