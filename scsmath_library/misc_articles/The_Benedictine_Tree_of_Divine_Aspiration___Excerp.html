              I first came here to Mauritius, I noticed some very auspicious symptoms. 
              I noticed that the trees bear so much fruit, the earth is very fertile, 
              and all the people are very conscious of religion. I was surprised 
              to see that this country is like a heaven on earth! I also saw that 
              many mangoes had fallen from the trees, and many other trees bore 
              ripe papayas and other fruit, yet nobody collected that fruit. Seeing 
              these symptoms immediately inspired me to remember Sri Vrindavan 
              Dham. There we find ripe fruit on the trees everywhere, and the 
              souls residing there are full of the mood of service. They are all 
              eternally engaged in the divine service of the Supreme Lord. We 
              find such descriptions of Goloka-Vrindavan, the holy abode of Lord 
              Krishna, in <font color="#666666">Sri Brahma Samhita</font>. This 
              holy book was brought by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu from South India, 
              and it is widely accepted by religious authorities as the authentic 
              treatise depicting the teachings of Sriman Mahaprabhu. </font>

            we must worship Krishna. What is our want? We need love, we need beauty, 
            we need charm, we need ecstasy, and so on. These are essential for 
            our soul, which is always in a state of living, and has the properties 
            of thinking, feeling, and willing. The soul can move, and the <font color="#666666">jada</font>, 
            or the material, cannot move; but even within matter, there are living 
            souls. Within a tree is living a soul -- this has also been proved 
            by scientists such as Jagadish Bose. This knowledge is not new: in 
            the ancient Vedas we will find all knowledge given in a living way. 
            The knowledge given by the Vedas is that behind everything is the 
            living soul, and if we study the Vedas we will find this out. </font>

              good reaction; if he does bad, he will get a bad reaction. Every 
              action has a reaction. Newton's third law states that "every action 
              has an equal and opposite reaction." We should therefore try to 
              do good things, otherwise we shall not receive a good reaction. 
              And to get relief from all reaction, we must become Krishna conscious. 
              If we surrender fully to Krishna, everything will go directly into 
              His account. If all our actions are done in Krishna consciousness, 
              no reaction will come to us. This process has been given in <font color="#666666">Srimad

              use knowledge in many ways to try to gain happiness and a good result. 
              The best thing for the jiva is to try to know what is the transcendental 
              world's environment, and his place there. Who am I? Why am I here? 
              What is my destination in life? After death where will I go? In 
              this human body we can realize the answers to many such questions; 
              and that is called <font color="#666666">bhagavat-jnana, bhagavat-dharma</font>. 
              If we try to read and understand such topics, we will be benefitted.

            is necessary that in this life we try to know what is the super benefit 
            of our human life, and the super benefit of the soul. The soul is 
            actually transcendental, but our body is mortal. The transcendental 
            body is living in the mortal body, whether it be a human body or any 
            other variety of species. </font>

              we are not this body -- we are living inside this body. We can understand 
              this when we see a person who is dying. At that time we cannot give 
              them any more days. We can understand that inside the body is the 
              spirit of that person. With the spirit is thinking, feeling, and 
              willing, and that is called the jiva, or the soul. When a man dies, 
              that soul leaves his temporary material body. This is not only Indian 
              philosophy, but in the Western countries also we find famous philosophers 
              such as Hegel who have had similar realizations. </font>

              must try to do something good for our self, for our soul. Good is 
              possible through the processes of humility, tolerance, and giving 
              honor to others. We should try to avoid the opposing environment, 
              and in that way we can happily study what is the soul, what is God, 
              and what is the super benefit of this life. Also, we should study 
              where we have come from, where we will go, etc. Birth and death 
              is natural in this world, and we are always getting happiness and 
              sadness and many other temporary feelings. We must try to understand 
              all these things. Prahlada Maharaj said: </font>

              their tendency is to be real searchers, and they are practicing 
              to do good according to their capacity, while avoiding bad things.
