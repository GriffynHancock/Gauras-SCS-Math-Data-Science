            Laksmi Devi, <em>dhava </em>means the husband, that is Narayana. Another 
            way that we can express it is, <em>ma </em>means Radharani and <em>dhava

          <p align="justify">I can remember one thing, and that day I was very 
            surprised. We were very sad, extremely sad that day when Guru Maharaj 
            disappeared, 12th August 1988. But when Guru Maharaj disappeared, 
            before that we have seen many symptoms in this Earth. An earthquake 
            came, a very heavy earthquake, heavier than I have seen in my life 
            of sixty years. And many other symptoms came, very suddenly! After 
            seeing them I told my Godbrothers, "Now Guru Maharaj must leave this 
            world, and within three to four days this will happen. And after leaving 
            this world, also within three to four days again this type of symptom 
            will come in this Earth." </p>
          <p align="justify">That is, Guru Maharaj is a great devotee of Krishna, 
            and when he leaves this mundane world, really, the jewel of the garland 
            must fall down, like a star from the sky. Then some disturbance and 
            symptoms must come again. And it happened. </p>
          <p>And we were arranging the <em>samadhi </em> of Guru Maharaj, Sripad 
            Sagar Maharaj was there. When I came to the Deities for paying dandavats 
            and I stood to see the Deities' faces - very effulgent, very glorified, 
            extremely glorified and very effulgent, and smiling like man, eyes 
            like man's eyes especially Radharani and Krishna and Mahaprabhu. It 
            was beyond my thinking, and I could not understand why on this day 
            the Deities were very happy and They cannot hide Their heart's expression. 
            And after seeing that I thought that Guru Maharaj has joined his <em>Nitya-lila, 
            </em> eternal Pastimes of Krishna, Radharani and Mahaprabhu, and this 
            symptom coming out from the form of our Deities. My heart was very 
            sad, but looking at the form of the Deities I was stunned and I could 
            not imagine that form, and I could feel some peace in my mind. Oh, 
            Guru Maharaj was with us and the Deities were suffering because of 
            that, and now Guru Maharaj has gone to join the Pastimes of Radha-Krishna 
            and Mahaprabhu, and They are happy. </p>
          <p align="justify">We need that and we shall try to make the Deities 
            happy. And like a man, but it is very effulgent, I cannot speak it, 
            never have I seen in my whole life such beauty in the Deities. </p>
          <p align="justify">This is <em>Madhava tithi. </em> When Krishna, Radharani, 
            and His associates are appearing in this mundane world, and when disappearing, 
            all these days are very auspicious for the devotee - that is called 
            <em>Madhava tithi. </em> That is, Madhava is getting the happiness. 
            That day we must try in a more glorifying way to give our service 
            to our Lordship and with great care we shall try to give honour to 
            that date. <img src="../../../grfx/trnsprnt.gif" width="600" height="5"></p>
