        They are taking so much from material nature and now that reaction is 
        coming. This type of illusory environment also happened a long time ago 
        in the time of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. People are taking so much material 
        benefit that the earth cannot tolerate it, so there must be some reaction 
        in the form of disturbances from the environment. </div>
		
      
      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify">In America there have been 
        so many disturbances by <i>prakriti</i> <span class="verdana_body_12pt-grey">[such 
        as the hurricanes and floods in New Orleans]</span> and now there has 
        been a big disturbance in India and Pakistan by an earthquake. What can 
        people do when an earthquake comes? But still I hear our devotees are 
        not disturbed by the disturbances: earthquake, tsunami, etc.</p>
      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify">Actually what is happening 
        in the external world is causing the world to go to a hellish position. 
        Here in Bengal they are giving so much energy for Durga Puja but Mother 
        Durga is the negative power of Lord Krishna. The positive power is Radharani, 
        and the negative power is Durga. Today they are especially worshipping 
        Durga, but all the activities of the external world are <i>moha grasta,</i> 
        captured by illusion.</p>
      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify">In the book <i>Chandi</i> is 
        a mantra with which they worship Durga. They are saying: <i>&quot;Ya Devi 
        sarva-bhutesu Vishnu Mayi iti sabdita&#133; namastasay namastasay namastasay 
        namo namah.</i> Whose name is Vishnu Maya has taken form as Durga... and 
        we are paying our obeisances to that Durga.&quot; </p>

        Maya and that everything is going to Vishnu but they are not worshipping 
        Vishnu. This is the illusion. They are saying &quot;Vishnu Maya,&quot; 
        that Durga is the power of Vishnu, so Vishnu is the Supreme Personality 
        - as Krishna's form - and He is the Godhead. They know it through this<font color="#009900"> 
        </font>mantra, and every day they are using that mantra - but they are 
        not worshiping Him.</p>

      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Through this sloka we can 
        understand consciousness is everywhere and when consciousness is pure, 
        consciousness is in its proper position and has a connection with the 
        transcendental world. Otherwise all is material thinking and we are dancing 
        over that material, but inside there is consciousness.</p>
      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Our consciousness is covered

      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify">Although everything is covered 
        by illusion we are trying to get the association of the transcendental 
        divine form of the Lord, and that is Hari Nam. We are always chanting 
        Hari Nam and through that we want to get some association of the Lord. 
        When the Lord will appear in our heart, He will dance on our tongue and 
        the illusory environment will leave us. An example is when we light a 
        match in a dark room which has been dark for a long time, even hundreds 
        of years, the darkness will immediately go out.</p>
      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify">This is the power of consciousness. 
        We want to get the association of that consciousness by our practising 
        life, and when that consciousness will be connected with the transcendental 
        realm without offense - so we should chant purely - everything we'll find.
