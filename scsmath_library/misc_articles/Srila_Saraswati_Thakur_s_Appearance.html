        <FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>The illusory

        so </FONT><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
        size=4>many ways. But Prabhupad Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati started 
        the cleansing process, like <I>Gundicha-marjjan</I>, the cleansing of 
        the Lord's Temple. This was his first work in this world. </FONT> 
        <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>The heart 
        must be made like Vrndavan. It won't do to keep a jungle in the heart. 
        Many disturbing elements are in the jungle, but there is nothing like 
        that in Vrndavan. Everything in Vrndavan is perfectly pure. So we must 
        worship the Supreme Lord purely. To mix with <I>maya</I> for our sense 
        pleasure and invite God in our heart is gross hypocrisy. With great 
        force, Srila Bhaktivinod Thakur and Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati 
        Thakur did everything in their power to smash such hypocrisy. 
</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>Their first 
          work was to preach the Name. In Bengal so many would chant the Name, 
          but in a hashish-smoking party. Some would chant for hours on end. There 
          was no dearth of such <I>Harinama</I> in Bengal, but the qualification 
          of real purity was absent. Because of this, Mahaprabhu's <I>Sampradaya</I> 
          or religious succession became completely adulterated. People uttered 
          the name 'Vaisnava' with hatred. The groups known as Neda, Darabesa, 
          Sani, Aul, Baul, Karttabhaja, etc. -- they all made such a hodgepodge 
          of Mahaprabhu's high and confidential teachings of divine perfection, 
          that </FONT><FONT 
        face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>Mahaprabhu was no 
          longer respected by the people. If anyone said, "A Vaisnava is at the 
          door," the head of the family would say, "Oh, give him a little rice 
          and send him off." Such was the conception the common people had of 
          Vaisnavas. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>But the 
        real Vaisnava-<I>dharmma</I> is <I>jaiva</I>-<I>dharmma</I>, the nature 
        of the soul, the divine life of the soul. Bhaktivinod Thakur wrote his 
        book <I>Jaiva-dharmma </I>to bring genuine Vaisnava religion out to the 
        world. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>Sri 
        Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has taught, "The real identity of the soul is as an 
        eternal servitor of Krsna. He is Krsna's marginal potency, present 
        simultaneously distinct yet non-distinct from Krsna." And it was this 
        type of transcendental knowledge that Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati 
        Goswami brought here. That was already present but hidden in the 
        Scriptures or holy books, and he revealed it. Srila Bhakti Siddhanta 
        Saraswati Goswami's unique contribution was the 
        <I>daiva-varnasrama-dharmma</I>, or Godly socio-religious society, 
        according to the proper interpretation of the Scriptures: 
        <I>daiva-varnasrama-dharmma, hari-bhakti yara marmma, sastra yukti 
        karila nischaya</I>. The so-called 'religion' that goes on in the 
        material world is demoniac or <I>asura-varnasrama</I>, but the 
        <I>daiva-varnasrama-dharmma</I> always strives to worship the Lord. 
        There are many devotional duties, but their aim is exclusively the 
        satisfaction of the Lord. </FONT></P>

        purpose but worshipping the Lord. The execution of these functions is 
        known, in its primary stage, as <I>daiva-varnasrama</I>. The bodily 
        calculation of considering a <I>brahmana's</I> son a <I>brahmana</I>, or 
        a <I>sudra's</I> son a <I>sudra</I>, etc., is false. </FONT></P>

          real Vaisnavism in the world. A Vaisnava is never inferior to a <I>brahmana</I>. 
          A Vaisnava is always superior to a <I>brahmana</I>. That is his real 
          position. The position of a Vaisnava is never merely 'next' to a <I>brahmana</I>. 
          The Vaisnava lives in the other world -- the transcendental world of 
          service, <I>seva-maya-bhumika</I>, or <I>nirguna-bhumika</I>, the transcendental 
          plane. And <I>varnasrama-dharmma</I> is in the <I>saguna-bhumika</I>, 
          the plane of mundane qualities. But the attempt to rise above the <I>mayik</I>

          many things in a new light, in the pure line. The chanting process,

        <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>Once, along 
          with Srila Guru Maharaj, we visited his Godbrother Sauren Babu. A big 
          <I>pandit</I> who was very much opposed to Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati 
          Goswami also came to that meeting. Guru Maharaj gave his lecture, and 
          after that, on the invitation of Sauren Babu, that pandit gave his lecture. 
          He admitted, "We can now understand that we were wrong, and Srila Bhakti 
          Siddhanta Prabhupad was right. In my youth, I heavily opposed his preaching, 
          but that was my great wrong. I now can say that he was upholding genuine 
          righteousness, and all of us who opposed him were wrong. The <I>gosani, 
          pandits, sahajiya</I> -- all were wrong." At that time so-called Vaisnavism 
          was very 'low-classism.' But after Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati 
          Prabhupad it again rose to its high, glorious position. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=4>This verse 
          is the personification of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami. 
          What is the worship he showed us? And how is it executed? Both are shown 
          here. Before, if a Vaisnava came to the door, everybody would think 
          he was naked but for a <I>kaupin</I>; or at least his cloth must be 
          dirty. And he wore beads and <I>tilak</I>. <I>Matha neda kopani pada, 
          nake tilak galay mala</I>. This was how Bhaktivinod Thakur described 
          the pseudo-Vaisnava. <I>Eho ta' ek kalira chela</I>: like a servant 
          of Kali, a devil. This whole anomaly was smashed by Srila Bhakti Siddhanta 
          Saraswati Goswami. He established big maths (monasteries) and mandirs 
          (temples). He engaged all the fruits of technology and materialism - 
          motor cars, printing presses and so many things -- for spreading Krsna 
          consciousness all over the world. </FONT></P>
        <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
        size=4>His preaching began at Ulta Dingi Junction Road, in Calcutta. There 
          was a two-storied building, with only one room upstairs. Downstairs 
          there were four rooms where four Vaisnava families lived -- all his 
          disciples -- and with their donations they kept him in the single room 
          upstairs. I have seen that room personally. His preaching began from 
          there. Later, he rented another house for preaching. Despite that humble 
          beginning, the world can now see the result of the preaching of Srila 
          Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami. </FONT></P>

        size=4>Generally, we think that a saint flies away from this world of 
          <I>maya</I> and goes to a </FONT></P>
        <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
        size=4>solitary place where he can enter into a cave and engage himself 
        in meditation. Indian saints generally preach, "Give up everything, go 
        to a solitary place in the jungle, find a cave, and engage yourself 
        fully in understanding Godhead." But our Guru Maharaj was different. 
        Like Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu, he wanted to attack <I>maya</I> 
        and, like a great general, he declared totalitarian war on illusion and 
        even all other existing conceptions of religion. "Why is there this 
        misunderstanding and misconception?" he thought. "Everything belongs to 
        Krsna: <I>isavasyam</I> <I>idam sarvam.</I> It is plain and simple and 
        sweet. How can we think, 'This is for me, that is for Him?' Why should 
        we let this misconception stand here at all? Attack it - and crush the 
        whole thing!" </FONT></P>
        <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
        size=4>He told us, "Kirtana means to preach against misconception. As 
          soldiers, you must go door to door and preach Krsna consciousness - 
          Krsna's interest -- the Krsna conception. If they understand that everything 
          is for Krishna, they will be saved. This truth is plain and simple. 
          Why should they not understand this? Try to capture them, to release 
          them from the world of misconception and misunderstanding where they 
          are now suffering from reaction." </FONT></P>
        <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
        size=4>In this way, we are not afraid of anything. A Vaisnava who loved 
          solitary life once asked our Guru Maharaj, "Why do you stay at Calcutta? 
          That is the place of Satan, where fighting for selfish interest is so 
          acute. Leave that -- come to the holy dhama." But Srila Bhakti Siddhanta 
          Saraswati Thakur especially chose that place, saying, "I prefer to represent 
          Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's creed in an extremely contaminated place." 
          For this reason, he wanted to send men to the West. "The East is captured 
          by the glamour of Western civilization," he said, "so Western civilization 
          must first be crushed. Then, its glamour will vanish and the whole world 
          will come to join the campaign of divine love of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu." 
          This was the same spirit with which Nityananda Prabhu canvassed the 
          fallen souls of this world, in his attempt to take them to the lotus 
          feet of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. </FONT></P>
