              the universal flow, the universal wave. At present we are being 
              carried away by different waves of separate-interest consciousness: 
              anartha -- it is not necessary for us. Our only necessity is to 
              merge in the wave of the universal interest, which is for Itself, 
              for Himself. The Lord says: </font>

              from that is anartha. Anartha means "meaningless," it has no meaning. 
              The only real meaning or purpose worthy to be served is the connection 
              with the universal wave, the universal movement. Anything besides 
              that is anartha -- undesirable and unnecessary. The anarthas will 
              serve no purpose. We are in connection with anarthas, undesirable

              most universal, fundamental wave and we have to catch that. Our 
              goal, our satisfaction, and the very fulfillment of our life is 
              only to be found there, in that layer, in that plane, and not in 
              the superficial plane of nationality interest, family interest, 
              or social service, for that is provincialism. </font>

              section of the population is busy with many local interests, and 
              another section wishes to stop all activity. To stop one's own movement, 
              to do away with one's own existence, is renunciation or <font color="#666666">samadhi</font>, 
              and that is suicidal. We have to give up renunciation as well as 
              enjoyment. The tendency to do evil and the tendency to go on strike 
              -- both are to be given up. In a nation, we may find so many workers 
              doing some wrong, going against the principle of the law, and that 
              is bad because it is disorderly - but to go on strike or to refuse 
              to work is also bad. The good path is to work only for the interest 
              of the country. </font>

              it may be. Whether self-centered, family-centered, village-centered 
              or society-centered as in humanitarianism -- it is all only a part 
              of the Infinite. This is the fact, and generally we are to try to 
              understand things in such a way. The technical words like <font color="#666666">anartha 
              nivrtti, bhava, asakti</font>, all these are covered by this understanding.

            here we are told that lust really lives in the intelligence, the mind, 
            and the senses. To conquer that lust we have to regulate the senses, 
            but in order to do so we must first analyze what the senses are and 
            what is their position, and then what is the position of the internal 
            king of the senses, the mind. After that we must analyze what is the 
            intrinsic position of the <font color="#666666">buddhi</font>, or 
            the faculty of reason, judgement, and intelligence. With the help 
            of reason, we must try to find out what is in the background of that 
            faculty of reason, of judgement, and of decision-making. </font>

              opposite to the world of experience. In <font color="#666666">Srimad 
              Bhagavatam</font>, an example is given that in the night a cloud 
              may cover the moon. Though the cloud obscures the moon, still the 
              cloud can only be seen by the light of the moon. </font>

            this example the soul is likened to the moon and the <font color="#666666">ahankara</font> 
            is likened to cloud cover. The sense-consciousness, the mind, and 
            the intelligence have all combined to form a system, <font color="#666666">ahankara</font>, 
            which has covered the soul. But they are seen, and it is possible 
            for them to act, only because there is light -- the light of the soul, 
            the moon. So by the help of our reason we must try to perceive what 
            is above reason, and we shall come to see that it is the <font color="#666666">atma</font>, 
            or the soul. In this way we may have some direct connection with the 
            <font color="#666666">atma</font>, or at least some conception, however 
            vague, of its existence and nature. At that time our whole material 
            aspiration will turn into trash and within ourselves we will be able 
            to conquer all the charms of this world. The Lord's advice in Srimad 
            <font color="#666666">Bhagavad Gita</font> is to somehow or other 
            try to obtain understanding of the true nature of our own atma. We 
            are really of such a superior nature and hold a noble, dignified position 
            in the higher plane, but lust and so many base things have come to 
            entrap us. </font>
