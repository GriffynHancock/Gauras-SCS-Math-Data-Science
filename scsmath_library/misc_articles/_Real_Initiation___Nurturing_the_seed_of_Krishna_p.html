It will give a very good result in the  future. But all depends upon <i>sraddha,</i> faith. <i>Adau sraddha, tatah sadhu-sanga.</i> First faith, then  the saintly association is ours.  And the translation of <i>sraddha</i> is more than just 'faith'. It is actually <i>affectionate</i> faith.</p>      <p class="style1">Chanting the Holy  Name is also like this. We are chanting Hare Krishna, but are we really  chanting? Or are we just creating a completely material sound vibration?</p>      <p class="style1">Srila Rupa Goswami  has described this very nicely: <i>atah Sri Krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih. </i>How should we  chant? <i>Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau Svayam eva sphuraty adah:</i> He will reveal Himself. When He is  happy with us, He will feel, &quot;Here is My dancing stage&quot;. If we properly prepare  that stage, He will happily come to dance on our tongues. We cannot expect to  catch the Holy Name with our mundane tongue. The Holy Name is transcendental,  and we cannot catch it by the use of our mundane senses.</p>      <table width="185" align="left">        <tr>          <td><div align="left"><img src="GovMj-InitiationArticle-02.jpg" width="175" height="263" border="1" align="left"></div></td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="style1">This is why Guru  Maharaj gave much importance to service life. <i>Seva</i> is service. The attitude of service is necessary.  And when we are firm in our service attitude, the stage will be automatically  built in our bodies. So many say they are initiated, but have they got real initiation  or not? In the <i>Chaitanya-charitamrta</i> it is said:</p>      <p class="style1"><b>diksa-kale bhakta  kare atma-samarpana</b><br>          <b>sei kale krsna  tare kare atma-sama</b><br>          <i>(Antya-lila, 4.192)</i></p>      <p class="style1">When one is  initiated by a genuine Guru, because the Guru is non-different from Krishna, Krishna will take the full charge of the disciple. And  when Krishna does that, nothing mundane can  remain. <i>Atma-sama</i>  means  transcendental. Krishna makes him  transcendental. When he surrenders to the Guru, Krishna  makes him transcendental. <i>Sei deha kare tara chidanandamaya</i>  -- his  form appears the same, but it is transformed to a transcendental form. We see  this devotee seated here, but his form is transcendental. <i>Sei deha</i> means 'that body',  takes a transcendental form. Then <i>aprakrta-dehe Krsna-charana bhajaya</i> -- after that, the  disciple does <i>bhajan,</i> divine service, and Krishna  accepts his service.</p>      <p class="style1">So where is the  justification of all this? If everyone says it is all false, then will no one  take initiation? But another part of <i>Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta</i> explains to us that  this is a certain stage of development.</p>      <p class="style1"><b>brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva</b><br>          <b>guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija</b><br>          <i>(Madhya-lila, 19.151)</i></p>      <p><span class="style1"><i>Premno hi bija-pradam.</i> The Guru takes the responsibility to give the  seed of Krishna-<i>prema,</i>  Love of God. So we are not to  be hopeless! Now if we are given the seed, if we plant it properly, it will  gradually become transcendental. This is the inner meaning.</span></p>      <p class="style1">So we cannot be  hopeless. The other day I said that we have got two very great Gurus -- one is  Srila Swami Maharaj  and one is Srila  Guru Maharaj. So we have no  doubt that we have also got the real seed. The seed is genuine -- we see that all over the world  people are chanting Hare Krishna. It is a fact -- everybody knows now. Even in Russia, there  also they know about Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu. Also in Hungary.  And this consciousness was given by Srila Swami Maharaj, and Srila Swami  Maharaj considered Srila Guru Maharaj as his Guru. So we have no doubt that we  have not only got a great Guru, but we have two great Gurus.</p>      <p class="style1">They are <i>karna-dhara</i> -- they are our  Guardians. The Guru is the captain of the ship. If we do not follow the orders  of the captain, that is our defect, not his. So we should now try to plant that  seed properly. That duty is called <i>bhajana-kriya</i> or proper performance of devotional duties  and services. Through that, <i>anartha-nivrtti</i> or purification will automatically  come.<font color="#333333" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><br>      </i></font> </p>      <hr>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td class="style1"><img src="../../../grfx/icon_tilak_trnsprnt.gif" width=28 height=40 align="left">Sri       Chaitanya Saraswat Math, Nabadwip<br>      <a href="http://scsmath.com">http://scsmath.com</a>       | <a href="http://scsmath.com/centers.html">Main Centres</a> | <a href="http://scsmath.com/new.html">What's&nbsp;New?</a></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>      <hr>    </td>  </tr></table>
