            Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj first met sometime in the year 1930 in 
            Allahabad, India. In a taped conversation recorded in a 1973 meeting 
            at Srila Sridhar Maharaj's Math at Nabadwip Dham, Srila Bhaktivedanta 
            Swami Maharaj recalls: "So, we are very fortunate to hear His Divine 
            Grace, Om Vishnupad Paramahamsa Parivrajkacarya Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar 
            Maharaj. By age and by experience, in both ways, he is senior to me. 
            I was fortunate to have his association since a very long time, perhaps 
            in 1930, something like that. At that time, he did not accept sannyas; 
            he just left home, and as a <font color="#666666">vanaprastha</font>, 
            in his white dress, he went to Allahabad. 
            <p> "<b>M</b>aharaj [To Srila Sridhar Maharaj] I think you remember 
              the incident when you went to Allahabad? On that auspicious occasion, 
              we were connected . There is a long story, it will take time, but 
              I had the opportunity of associating with Sridhar Maharaj for several 
              years. Krishna and Prabhupad liked him to prepare me." 
            <p> "<b>S</b>ridhar Maharaj lived in my house for many years, so naturally, 
              we had very intimate talks and he was my good advisor. I took his 
              advices, instructions, very seriously because from the very beginning 
              I know that he is a pure Vaishnava, a pure devotee, and I wanted 
              to associate with him and tried to help him also. Our relationship 
              is very intimate." 
            <p> <b>H</b>erein, we find the history of a transcendental relationship 
              between these two pure devotees of the Lord. Addressing Srila Sridhar 
              Maharaj as "His Divine Grace" and Om Vishnupad -- forms of address 
              for one regarded as a spiritual master -- Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami 
              Maharaj has transcended the norms of social etiquette and superficial 
              formality. Intimately associating together for a concentrated period 
              of over five years, often for five to seven hours daily, Srila Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami Maharaj considered that "Krishna and Prabhupad liked him to 
              prepare me" for his future expansive missionary activities in the 
              Western world. While remembering their intimate talks, specifically 
              in regard to <font color="#666666">Bhagavad Gita</font>, Srila Sridhar 
              Maharaj recalls the depth in penetration of their discussions. "Once 
              while discussing the verse <font color="#666666">dadami buddhiyogam 
              tam yena mam upayanti te</font> ["I give them the understanding 
              by which they can come to Me" <font color="#666666">Bhagavad Gita</font> 
              10.10] I submitted to him that here, <font color="#666666">upayanti</font> 
              is indicative of <font color="#666666">parakiya rasa</font> [paramour 
              relationship] . On this point he agreed with me, saying, 'Yes, at 
              this point there cannot be anything but the <font color="#666666">parakiya 
              rasa</font> of Vraja. The conclusion of <font color="#666666">Bhagavad 
              Gita</font> must come to this." 
            <p> <b>R</b>ecognizing Srila Sridhar Maharaj as "a pure Vaishnava, 
              a pure devotee" since the beginning of their relationship, Srila 
              Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj most highly valued his instructions 
              and advice. He would often consult with him regarding the spiritual 
              significance of his failing business and family relationships. 
            <p> <b>A</b>n example of how Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj tried 
              to help Srila Sridhar Maharaj in his preaching work is seen in his 
              appreciating Srila Sridhar Maharaj's uncanny ability for extracting 
              the essence of the scriptures. He helped to finance the publication 
              of Srila Sridhar Maharaj's original Sanskrit-Bengali work entitled 
              <a href="prapanna_jivnmrtm_about.html">Prapanna Jivanamrta</a>: 
              The Nectar of Surrender. The book, as well as containing original 
              Sanskrit verses composed by Srila Sridhar Maharaj, is a compilation 
              of verses from various Vaishnava scriptures such as <font color="#666666">Srimad 
              Bhagavatam</font>, and includes excerpts from the works of Rupa 
              Goswami. It is divided according to the six divisions of surrender.

            other parts of India, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj and Srila 
            Sridhar Maharaj's relationship continually developed. Srila Bhaktivedanta 
            Swami Maharaj continues to recall their meeting: 
            <p> "<b>I</b>n my householder life I had opened an office in Bombay 
              for our business. The Bombay Gaudiya Math was established by Sridhar 
              Maharaj and myself. We made two parties for begging, collecting 
              alms. Sridhar Maharaj, myself, and Bhakti Saranga Goswami Maharaj. 
              So, I took them to my chemist friends and I collected about five 
              hundred rupees. Sridhar Maharaj would speak, I would introduce, 
              and Goswami Maharaj would canvass." 
            <p> <b>I</b>n the <font color="#666666">Srila Prabhupad Lilamrta</font>, 
              Satsvarup Das Goswami writes: "Abhay would often accompany Sridhar 
              Maharaj and his assistants at preaching programs, where he would 
              play the mrdanga. And when Sridhar Maharaj fell ill, Abhay led the 
              other devotees on preaching engagements, performing kirtan, playing 
              <font color="#666666">mrdanga</font>, and giving lectures on the 
              Bhagavatam." 
            <p> <b>W</b>hile still in Bombay, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj 
              and Sridhar Maharaj were the receiving party for a Gaudiya Math 
              sannyas upon his return from Europe. Although dismayed by his changed 
              appearance which was missing the <font color="#666666">tridanda</font> 
              of a Gaudiya Sannyasi, the <font color="#666666">sikha</font> of 
              a Vaishnava, as well as the traditional robes, they still eagerly 
              inquired in regard to the preaching field in the West. The sannyasi 
              remarked, "They ask questions that cannot be answered." Concerned, 
              Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj inquired further as to the nature 
              of those questions. One after another Srila Sridhar Maharaj answered 
              them all. At last, the sannyasi was left dumbfounded and Srila Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami boldly declared, "Today, Europe has been defeated by Asia!" 
            <p> <b>D</b>uring the lifetime of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati 
              Prabhupad, Srila Sridhar Maharaj once composed a poem describing 
              the ontological positions of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur and the line 
              of disciplic succession stemming from Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. 
              Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupad was so pleased with the 
              poem's ontological depth and its happy style that he remarked: "Bhaktivinoda 
              Thakur has written this through him. Now I am satisfied that although 
              I may go, at least one man remains behind who can represent my conclusions." 
              In further appreciation of Srila Sridhar Maharaj's writings, Srila 
              Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupad informed the editors of the 
              Gaudiya Math's periodicals, "If you include articles written by 
              Sridhar Maharaj, the quality of your publications will be greatly 
              improved." 
            <p> <b>A</b>fter the disappearance of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati 
              Prabhupad, the Gaudiya Math gradually diverged. With full knowledge 
              of the events surrounding the disintegration of the Gaudiya Math, 
              Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami told his disciples in the same 1973 conversation, 
              "Our relationship is very intimate. After the breakdown of the Gaudiya 
              Math, I wanted to organize another organization, making Sridhar 
              Maharaj the head." 
            <p> <b>R</b>eciprocating the appreciation, Srila Sridhar Maharaj advised 
              the leaders of the Gaudiya Sangha to confer the title "Bhaktivedanta" 
              upon the then Abhay Charan. Later, his sannyas-guru, Sripad Bhakti 
              Prajnana Kesava Maharaj, one of the senior-most disciples of Srila 
              Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and the first sannyas-disciple 
              of Srila Sridhar Maharaj, gave sannyas to Abhay Charan, retaining 
              the title "Bhaktivedanta," and conferring the sannyas name "Swami." 
            <p> <b>A</b>dditionally, when Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj returned 
              to India in October of 1967, after his successful preaching initiative 
              in America, he stayed with Srila Sridhar Maharaj in Nabadwip, and 
              observed his Vyasa Puja celebration. At that time, Srila Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami Maharaj wrote a letter to a disciple saying, "Yesterday, we 
              have all come to Nabadwip Dham. This place is an establishment of 
              one of my Godbrothers. It is a very nice and extensive place, and 
              my Godbrother B.R. Sridhar Maharaj has spared one entire house for 
              our stay. He has also agreed to cooperate with our society. We shall 
              observe his birthday celebration, and the <font color="#666666">brahmacaris</font> 
              shall learn how to celebrate the spiritual master's birthday." Shortly 
              afterwards, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj asked Srila Sridhar 
              Maharaj to be the president of his newly formed society -- the International 
              Society for Krishna Consciousness.

              talk, and he replied, "If I were to tell you, you would faint. Sridhar

              disciples, Sripad Govinda Maharaj. Concerned about his failing health,

              living in the United States or return to India to live his last 
              days in Vrindavan. After receiving Srila Sridhar Maharaj's reply, 
              he wrote: "What Sripad Sridhar Maharaj has directed, I take it on 
              my head. He is my always well-wisher. After the departure of Prabhupad 
              it is appropriate that I should accept his direction. I got direction

              travelled and preached extensively all over India, personally accompanying 
              Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur for many years. Nearly fifty years 
              ago, he established the Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math on the banks 
              of the Ganges in Nabadwip Dham, which is now a thriving institution. 
              His followers have established temples in major cities throughout 
              the world. His Sanskrit and Bengali writings have been appreciated 
              by both scholars and devotees for their originality, depth of realization, 
              and happy poetic style. Published and widely distributed throughout 
              the world, they are now available in English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese,

            <p> <b>T</b>hroughout his life, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj 
              always maintained the highest respect and confidence in Srila Sridhar 
              Maharaj. He considered that whenever it was not possible for his 
              disciples to proceed directly under his guidance, that they should 
              take direction from Srila Sridhar Maharaj. He once wrote in a letter 
              to one of his students: "Because you are my disciple, and I think, 
              a sincere soul, it is my duty to refer you to someone who is competent 
              to act as a Siksha Guru. For spiritual advancement of life, we must 
              go to someone who is actually practicing spiritual life. So, if 
              you are actually serious to take instructions from a Siksha Guru, 
              I can refer you to the one who is the most highly competent of all 
              my godbrothers. This is B.R. Sridhar Maharaj, whom I consider to 
              be even my Siksha Guru, so what to speak of the benefit that you 
              can have by his association. So, if you are serious about the advancement 
              of your spiritual life, I will advise you to go to Sridhar Maharaj. 
              It will be very good for your spiritual benefit, and I will feel 
              that you are safe. When I was in India with the others, we lived 
              with Sridhar Maharaj. You can also make arrangements for your other 
              Godbrothers to go there in the future. So, live peacefully with 
              Sridhar Maharaj, and thereby you will be spiritually enlightened."

              he states: "One should know the instructing spiritual master to 
              be the Personality of Krishna. Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami states 
              that there are two kinds of instructing spiritual masters. One is 
              the liberated person fully absorbed in meditation in devotional 
              service and the other is he who invokes the disciple's spiritual 
              consciousness by means of relevant instructions. There is no difference 
              between the shelter-giving Supreme Lord and the initiating and instructing 
              spiritual masters. If one foolishly discriminates between them, 
              he commits an offense in the discharge of devotional service." [<font color="#666666">Chaitanya

              Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj possessed the highest respect and appreciation 
              for Sridhar Maharaj, and Srila Sridhar Maharaj is unparalleled in 
              his understanding and admiration of Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj,

              conceived and Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur began to translate 
              this conception into action. And we find that through Swami Maharaj, 
              in his last days, it has been fulfilled to such a great extent.

              guru's mercy and the blessings of the Vaishnavas. Otherwise, how 
              I may have? So, I wish that Sridhar Maharaj may bestow his blessings 
              as he was doing always, and may Guru Maharaj help me so I can do 
              some service. By his grace it has become successful. I have no credit.

            <p> <b>A</b>nd after the disappearance of Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami 
              Maharaj, Srila Sridhar Maharaj declared: "I consider him to be <font color="#666666">saktyavesa 
              avatara</font>, and it is confirmed in his writings on his spiritual 
              journey through the Atlantic. How he landed there in America, and 
              the nature of his beginning the movement, his intense degree of 
              dedication to Krishna and dependence, and how much he made himself 
              empty of any other desire than the order of his Gurudev, quite empty 
              that Krishna came down to help him, and it is corroborated that 
              Krishna worked on his behalf. In his poem, Prayer to the Lotus Feet 
              of Krishna, we find him pleading with Krishna, "My dear Brother, 
              Your good fortune will come to You only when Srimati Radharani be 
              comes pleased with You." Seeing his Gurudeva Srila Bhakti Siddhanta 
              Saraswati as Radharani's delegation and his order as Her divine 
              service, he humbly submitted that he did not feel himself worthy 
              or fit to discharge the divine service, so he enlisted Krishna in 
              the service of his guru. He had completely dedicated himself to 
              the purpose, he was so earnest in his prayer to Krishna that he 
              may discharge the duty that he has been given by his Guru Maharaj, 
              that divine force, power, came down to help him. Otherwise, it is 
              impossible. It is not a thing of the ordinary level that anyone 
              will do, but the highest thing has been taken down to the lowest 
              position so extensively. It cannot but be the divine power, embodied 
              and in a great intensity and magnitude! So, <font color="#666666">saktyavesa

          <td><b>W</b>ith such appreciation, there should be little doubt why 
            Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj had implicit faith in Srila Sridhar 
            Maharaj. He had even heard directly from Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati 
            Prabhupad of the exceptional qualifications of Srila Sridhar Maharaj. 
            In their last known recorded meeting in 1977, just prior to Srila 
            Bhaktivedanta Swami's leaving this mortal world, we find him imploring 
            Srila Sridhar Maharaj to take up residence at his temple in Sridham 
            Mayapur. 
            <p> <b>T</b>he conversation that ensues is a transcript of their taped 
              conversation of March 1977. 
            <p> <b>Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami</b>: I do not know for how long I 
              will be able to carry on. So, I came to see Sridhar Maharaj. 
            <p> <b>Devotee</b>: If you all go away, then the world will become 
              dark. 
            <p> <b>Srila Sridhar Maharaj</b>: [to Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami] It 
              is so wonderful that the will of the Lord becomes manifest through 
              someone. 
            <p> <b>Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami</b>: I want very much, Maharaj, that 
              you come and stay at Mayapur. Because Prabhupad always desired that 
              you preach. He told me quite a few times, "Why don't you pull him 
              out?" [They both laugh.] You know, I also tried to some extent before, 
              but somehow or other it did not work out. Now, why don't you come 
              and stay at Mayapur? Srila Prabhupad told me also, "Sridhar Maharaj 
              is one of the finest preachers." I want to take you everywhere. 
              At least at the place we have in Mayapur, people are coming from 
              all over the world. Why don't you come and stay there? If you just 
              agree, then whatever kind of building you want, I will arrange it 
              for you. They are trying to build a house for me. So both of us 
              will stay there. And whenever you want, you can come here to your 
              Math. 
            <p> <b>Srila Sridhar Maharaj</b>: Yes, as long as I am alive to fulfill 
              Prabhupad's desire. 
            <p> <b>Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami</b>: This is my earnest desire. Since 
              you could not go around the world and preach, at least stay there 
              and people will come to you. I shall make that arrangement. If you 
              stay, then it will be helpful to me also. Sometimes I need to consult 
              with someone but there is no one. There is no one that I can consult. 
              I feel this deficiency very greatly. 
            <p> <b>Devotee</b>: If he stays in Mayapur, then, all kinds of people 
              will get to hear from him. 
            <p> <b>Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami</b>: Yes, that's right. 
            <p> <b>Srila Sridhar Maharaj</b>: Yes, people from all kinds of cultural 
              backgrounds will come there. 
            <p> <b>Bhaktivedanta Swami</b>: Yes, and they are already coming. 
              And in that house I will make arrangements for an elevator so that 
              you won't have to go through the difficulty of walking up and down 
              the stairs. You won't even have to move a step yourself. I'll make 
              arrangements for a car and a lift. My disciples are telling me that 
              they will build a house for me. So, both of us will stay in that 
              house. Most of the time I am travelling around, so if you are there, 
              then they can get some guidance. So, Maharaj, please, give me the 
              order and I will make all the arrangements for you. That Planetarium 
              [The "Temple of Understanding"] also will be built under your direction. 
              My idea is to combine the Indian culture and the American money 
              -- the lame man and the blind man policy. I tell them also that 
              this will be very beneficial for the world.

          <td><b>H</b>ere, in their final meeting, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj 
            prophetically refers to his imminent disappearance and reveals that 
            it is in this connection that he has come to see Sridhar Maharaj. 
            In friendly jesting, they discuss Srila Sridhar Maharaj's reticence 
            regarding large-scale preaching work. Of himself, Srila Sridhar Maharaj 
            has remarked, "I did not want to become a big person. That is not 
            my nature. I did not want to move around with many people. I am just 
            satisfied with whatever I have. My spiritual thinking is my life. 
            The conclusions of the scriptures, the advices of the <font color="#666666">mahajanas</font>, 
            to relish them and practice them and to discuss them in a small confidential 
            circle, that is the main goal of my life." In the Ninth Canto of <font color="#666666">Srimad 
            Bhagavatam</font>, Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj, quoting Dhruva 
            Maharaj, writes: "'My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever 
            you have given me. I have nothing else to ask from You, for I am fully 
            satisfied to be engaged in Your service.' This is the mentality of 
            a pure devotee who does not want anything material or spiritual from 
            the Personality of Godhead. Our Krishna Consciousness Movement is 
            therefore called <font color="#666666">krsna bhavanamrta-sangha</font>, 
            the association of persons who are simply interested in thoughts of 
            Krishna." 
            <p> <b>S</b>rila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj testifies to his having 
              personally heard Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupad mark the high 
              qualifications of Srila Sridhar Maharaj, whom he had once requested 
              to go to the West. In this regard, Srila Sridhar Maharaj once remarked, 
              "My Guru Maharaj wanted me to go to the West for preaching, but 
              I don't consider myself a fit person to preach in the West. Because, 
              you see, I can't follow your intonation. So, [laughing] I must listen 
              clearly, then I shall tell. So, in this way, I told that if you 
              order, I must go, but I don't think that I am fit to preach in the 
              West. Anyhow, it was stopped, and Goswami Maharaj was sent to the 
              West." When Srila Sridhar Maharaj had been selected, one of his 
              godbrothers came to him and revealed the reason why Bhakti Siddhanta 
              Saraswati Prabhupad had chosen him to preach in the West. This godbrother 
              explained, "Do you know why Prabhupad wanted you to be sent to the 
              West? He said, 'Because he can't be converted.'" 
            <p> <b>A</b>nd just twenty-four hours before his departure from this 
              mortal world, Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Prabhupad called for his 
              beloved disciple Srila Sridhar Maharaj, and asked him to sing the 
              song of Narottama Das Thakur: <font color="#666666">Sri Rupa Manjari 
              Pada</font> [the lotus feet of Rupa Manjari are my treasure]. Srila 
              Sridhar Maharaj recalls: "So I did, hesitatingly. My nature is always 
              hesitating, pushing back. Then, Kunja Babu asked me to stop. I was 
              not a good singer, so as soon as he suggested, I stopped. Then, 
              Kunja Babu asked Puri Maharaj of Kalna, 'You sing.' So he began. 
              Then, Srila Prabhupad was a little disturbed. 'I don't like to hear 
              the sweet tune of the song,' he said. Then, he stopped, and I had 
              to begin again with <font color="#666666">sri rupa manjari pada, 
              sei mora sampada</font>. He wanted me to sing that song. That is 
              the fulfillment of life of everyone of us, to be Rupanuga -- followers 
              of Sri Rupa." 
            <p> <b>S</b>enior godbrothers who witnessed this exchange have described 
              it as a "mystic transmission" in which Srila Sridhar Maharaj was 
              given admittance into the eternal entourage of Sri Rupa Manjari. 
              Srila Sridhar Maharaj's humble vision, however, is that he was posted 
              as the gatekeeper, the guardian of devotion [<font color="#666666">bhakti-rakshak</font>], 
              to protect the storehouse of conclusive truths about the full-fledged 
              theistic conception of Sri Krishna, as given by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. 
            <p> <b>F</b>urther expressing his appreciation for Srila Sridhar Maharaj's 
              "high realizations" in Krishna consciousness, Srila Bhaktivedanta 
              Swami Maharaj says: "I want to take you everywhere. At least at 
              the place we have in Mayapur, people are coming from all over the 
              world. Why don't you stay there?" Sometimes it is wondered why Srila 
              Sridhar Maharaj apparently did not take up Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami's 
              offer. Srila Sridhar Maharaj explains: "I said, 'Of course I shall 
              try to help you. Sometimes I shall go and stay there with you.' 
              But I really did not think at the time that I shall survive him."

            most famous work, the <font color="#666666">Brhad Bhagavatamrtam</font>, 
            in which devotees, devotional service, and Krishna are described very 
            scientifically. On the basis of this transcendental literature, Srila 
            Sridhar Maharaj had contemplated an elaborate preaching exhibition, 
            showing graphically, with the use of dioramas depicting the varieties 
            of material and spiritual planetary systems, how the ultimate spiritual 
            destination is Krishna's own abode, Goloka Vrindavan. Due to insufficient 
            funds, Srila Sridhar Maharaj humbly submitted his idea to Srila Bhaktivedanta 
            Swami Maharaj, who approved, saying, "It will be built under your 
            direction."
