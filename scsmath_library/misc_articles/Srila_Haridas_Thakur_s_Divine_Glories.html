      <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"><i></i>Today is the Divine 
        Disappearance day of Srila Haridas Thakur, and early in the morning, after 
        Mangal Arati in Dum Dum Park in Kolkata, Srila Govinda Maharaj spoke of 
        Srila Haridas Thakur's divine glories. The following are several of the 
        themes His Divine Grace discussed. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> <img src="HDG_P9150001_220x.jpg" width="182" height="173" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" border="1">Srila 
          Haridas Thakur was an exemplary devotee who always preached by his words, 
          his actions, and his mind. Even before the appearance of Sri Chaitanya 
          Mahaprabhu he was already known as a dedicated devotee and preacher, 
          and after the appearance of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu he dedicated himself 
          to Mahaprabhu one hundred percent. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Srila Haridas Thakur was 
          an intimate friend of Sri Adwaita Acharya and Srivas Thakur. When Sri 
          Chaitanya Mahaprabhu appeared, Srila Haridas Thakur could understand 
          than an incarnation of the Lord had come because so many people were 
          enlivened and chanting the Holy Names of the Lord. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> After Mahaprabhu took sannyas, 
          Srila Haridas Thakur told the Lord that it was impossible for him to 
          continue living in Nabadwip and that his desire was to be with Mahaprabhu 
          in Puri. In Puri, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu asked Kasi Misra for some 
          place with a simple thatched hut, where there is a garden, and that 
          place is known as Siddha Bakul. Kasi Misra replied that everything is 
          for the satisfaction of the Lord Himself, and that Mahaprabhu did not 
          have to ask, that he could have any place he desired. So Haridas Thakur 
          was given that place, that garden house, in Siddha Bakul. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> The Lord stayed in the Gambhir 
          and daily he would go to visit Srila Haridas Thakur on his way to the 
          ocean, where he would bathe at midday. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> The society at that time 
          was very strongly opposed to accepting anyone who was a mleccha, and 
          Hinduism was very strong. Of course we are not Hindus, or Christians, 
          or Muslims, or any of those things - but Vaisnavas. Srila Govinda Maharaj 
          explained that <i>everyone</i> is coming from Vishnu, therefore all 
          are Vaisnavas. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Haridas Thakur was the Nama-Acharya 
          and always lived for the chanting and glorification of the Holy Names 
          of the Lord. When he heard Srila Rupa Goswami's glorification of the 
          Holy Name he was very moved: 
        <p> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="sloka.gif" width="385" height="60"></b></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p align="justify" class="verdana_body_12pt-grey"> &quot;I do not know 
            how much nectar the two syllables 'Krish-na' have produced. When the 
            Holy Name of Krishna is chanted, it appears to dance within the mouth. 
            We then desire many, many mouths. When that Name enters the holes 
            of the ears, we desire many millions of ears. And when the Holy Name 
            dances in the courtyard of the heart, it conquers the activities of 
            the mind, and therefore all the senses become inert.&quot; </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Haridas Thakur commented 
          that he had heard many verses glorifying the Holy Names but he had not 
          heard any verse like this glorification given by Srila Rupa Goswami. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu 
          lived for twenty-four years in Puri. The first six years He extensively 
          travelled, and the last twelve years He was absorbed completely tasting 
          Radha-Krishna lila in the Gambhir. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Haridas Thakur had a special 
          ability that he could understand that soon the Lord would disappear 
          and he commented that he did not want to see that final lila of the 
          Lord. He asked the Lord to grant his desire: that he could leave this 
          world before that final chapter of the Lord. In reply, Mahaprabhu assented, 
          and said that Lord Krishna would satisfy Haridas Thakur's petition. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> The next day Sri Chaitanya 
          Mahaprabhu came there with His devotees and began the chanting of the 
          Holy Names - a kirtan that lasted more than two hours. Then Haridas 
          Thakur took the lotus feet of the Lord upon his chest and began chanting, 
          &quot;Sri Krishna Chaitanya, Sri Krishna Chaitanya, Sri Krishna Chaitanya....&quot; 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> He had dedicated his entire 
          life to the chanting of Krishna's Name. His vow was to daily chant three 
          lakhs (300,000) Names of the Lord, chanting the Mahamantra. But at the 
          time of leaving this world, he chanted, &quot;Sri Krishna Chaitanya,&quot; 
          Mahaprabhu's Name, while looking at the lotus face of the Lord. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Then Mahaprabhu began dancing 
          while holding the body of Srila Haridas Thakur. After the soul passes 
          away, the body must be washed with water, and Mahaprabhu took Haridas 
          Thakur's body to the ocean. Then with His own hands, and with the help 
          of the devotees, Mahaprabhu dug a hole near the shore and, after burying 
          Haridas Thakur's body, a mound was made above the body for the samadhi. 
          In this way the Lord was engaged personally and it was very miraculous. 
          There, all the devotees had a big kirtan and then all went with the 
          Lord to bathe in the sea. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Afterwards, Sri Chaitanya 
          Mahaprabhu went to the shopkeepers near the Jagannath Temple, held out 
          his uttariya and begged Jagannath Prasad from them for the festival 
          of Srila Haridas Thakur. They all wanted to give all their stock of 
          prasadam to Mahaprabhu, but Swarup Damodar, who was so close to Sri 
          Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, told the Lord that he would collect the offerings 
          for the festival. In that way he collected a few palmfuls of each preparation 
          from each of the shopkeepers and accumulated a large quantity which 
          was then carried back for the festival. Kasi Misra also sent a large 
          quantity of Jagannath Prasad for the Lord and all the devotees. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> When all the devotees were 
          to take prasadam, the Lord wanted to serve them, but He wanted to give 
          each person more than what five men could eat. Then Swarup Damodar told 
          the Lord that unless He personally sat down to take prasad, no one would 
          eat. The Lord was made to sit, and Swarup Damodar and others then served 
          the devotees. 
        <p class="verdana_body_12pt" align="justify"> Today is the festival of 
          the disappearance of Srila Haridas Thakur, and as Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita 
          notes, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave the boon that all those who participated 
          in this festival, and those who will participate in the future festivals, 
          all will receive eternal benefit and go back to Krishna.
