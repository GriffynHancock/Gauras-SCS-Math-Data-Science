That is the position of Gadadhar Pandit;                         he is quite empty, and following Mahaprabhu. He is not                         full in himself. Something, the most important thing,                         his heart, has been taken by Mahaprabhu, so he has no                         other alternative but to follow Him.&quot;<BR>                      </P>                    </TD>                  </TR>                  </TBODY>                 </TABLE>              </TD>            </TR>            </TBODY>           </TABLE>          <P>In Gaura-lila, Gadadhar Pandit is holding the helm, everything belongs             to him; still he has to admit he's dispossessed, that Gauranga has             taken everything! He is exhaustively dedicated to Gauranga. So Srila             Kaviraja Goswami says: <i>teho laksmi-rupa, tara sama keha nai,</i>             that he represents the main potency of Gauranga, and no one is to             be compared with him. This is the conclusion of Srila Kaviraja Goswami             about Sri Gadadhar. He is <i>Gaura-premamaya,</i> the embodiment of             Sri Gaura's love.</P>        </DIV>        <P class=body align=justify>Gadadhar Das represents the halo of Radharani,           but Gadadhar Pandit represents Her mood, Her nature - Her heart.<strong><a href="#footer">*</a></strong>           It is as if Mahaprabhu has taken away Gadadhar Pandit's soul, and the           body is still standing! That is the position of Gadadhar Pandit; he           is quite empty, and following Mahaprabhu. He is not full in himself.           Something, the most important thing, his heart, has been taken by Mahaprabhu,           so he has no other alternative but to follow Him. He is wholly given           to Mahaprabhu. Gadadhar Pandit's position, the part he played, was something           like that of Radharani, Her heart stolen by Krishna, the empty body           still standing. <i>Radha-bhava-dyuti-subalitam naumi Krsna-svarupam:</i>           He was fully engrossed in the conception of Sri Gauranga. Gauranga had           taken everything from him, so he had no other alternative; he was fully           engrossed, captured completely by Him.</P>        <P class=body align=justify>We find his activity throughout his whole           life was like this. Of the other devotees, some were ordered to go to           Vrindavan, and some were allowed to go there, but though Gadadhar Pandit           wanted to visit Vrindavan with Mahaprabhu Himself, he was denied: &quot;No,           you won't go.&quot; When Jagadananda Pandit asked to go there, Mahaprabhu,           with hesitation, granted him permission, &quot;Yes, go there, but move           always under the guidance of Rupa and Sanatana.&quot; He also gave him           some special instructions: &quot;Do this, and this, and don't do that.&quot;           But Gadadhar Pandit was not allowed to go there.</P>        <p align="justify">He was the representation of Srimati Radharani Herself,           yet his peculiar position was such: the Queen of Vrindavan, but now           transferred to Nabadwip. His position had become just the opposite;           he could not enter Vrindavan! He prayed for permission, but Mahaprabhu           did not give it. <em><strong><a name="footer"></a></strong></em>He said,           &quot;No, stay and live here.&quot; And he had to do so. Sri Gadadhar           Pandit represents the predominated moeity of the Whole. The Whole consists           of predominating and predominated moeities, and he represents the predominated           half. He is one half of the Absolute Truth.</p>        <blockquote>          <p align="justify"><em><strong>*</strong>In the Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta             purports by Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupad (Adi-lila, 10.15)             it is stated that Srila Gadadhar Pandit, the fourth branch of the             Chaitanya tree, is the combination of Srimati Radharani and Lalita-sakhi.             In the Pancha-Tattva, Srila Gadadhar Pandit represents the internal             potency or pleasure potency of the Lord. In Adi-lila 10.53, it is             explained that Srila Gadadhar Das, the twenty-third branch of the             Chaitanya tree, is considered to be a united form of Chandrakanti,             who is the effulgence of Srimati Radharani, and Purnananda, who is             the foremost of Lord Balarama's very dear girlfriends. Thus Srila             Gadadhar Das was one of the associates of both Chaitanya Mahaprabhu             and Nityananda Prabhu.</em></p>        </blockquote>      </BLOCKQUOTE>      <TABLE cellPadding=0 width="97%" align=center border=0>        <TR>           <TD>             <DIV align=right><B><A             href="Disap_Gadadhar_BtvndTkr2.html"><FONT             size=3>On to page 2 &gt;&gt;</FONT></A></B></DIV>          </TD>        </TR>        <TBODY>         <TR>           <TD>&nbsp;</TD>        </TR>        <TR>           <TD>             <P align=right><I class=body-1>Webpages compiled by Damayanti Dasi,               UK </I></P>          </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>      </TABLE>      <HR>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD><IMG height=40       src="icon_tilak_trnsprnt.gif"       width=28 align=left>Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math, Nabadwip<BR>      <A       href="http://scsmath.com/">http://scsmath.com/</A> | <A       href="http://scsmath.com/centers.html">Main Centres</A> | <A       href="http://scsmath.com/new.html">What's&nbsp;New?</A></TD></TR>  <TR><TD>&nbsp; </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1><H1>&nbsp;</H1></BODY></HTML>
