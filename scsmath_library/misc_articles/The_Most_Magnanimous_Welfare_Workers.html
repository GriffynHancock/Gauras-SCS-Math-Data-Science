What do I care for my kingdom if I cannot meet with Mahaprabhu? I will put earrings on and become a yogi if I cannot meet with Mahaprabhu." He had such a strong desire: "What do I care for my kingdom!"<br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">Then, every day Nityananda Prabhu, Ramananda Raya, Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and others spoke with Mahaprabhu, telling Him about the King's devotion and his desire to meet with the Lord. Mahaprabhu's devotees gave nourishment on both sides; they are the media, and this is the position of Guru.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">When Sri Gurudev is coming, he is non-different from Krishna, but he is also the most super servitor of Lord Krishna, and he is coming for what? He is coming for bringing some message, the Lord's message. Krishna Himself told, "I cannot go now, so you go on My behalf. You go and give some message to My <i>jiva</i> souls, My friends." It is like this, 'The loving search for the lost servant.' And then we are going to Guru, and Guru is sending our message to the Lord. Sri Gurudev’s duty is like this.</p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">What were Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and Nityananda Prabhu doing? Every day they were telling: "Oh Mahaprabhu, King Prataparudra is a very good man, a very nice man. Please give him some mercy." Mahaprabhu answered, "He is a good man, I accept that, but he is a king. He is a king. He is a good man but he is a king! Then how can I see him?"</p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">But through Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy King Prataparudra got Mahaprabhu's mercy. At first, instead of meeting the King, Mahaprabhu agreed to meet with the King's son. Before going to meet with the Lord, Nityananda Prabhu told his son, "You can change your royal clothing into devotee clothing and if Mahaprabhu sees you, He will give His mercy to you."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">Mahaprabhu gave His mercy, and immediately when the son returned from meeting Mahaprabhu, King Prataparudra embraced him and was so happy to see he had received the mercy of Mahaprabhu. Another time Nityananda Prabhu sent the king some old clothing of Mahaprabhu, and the king would worship that clothing. In many ways King Prataparudra showed so much devotion for Mahaprabhu.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">Also Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya advised the king how he could meet with Mahaprabhu: “When Mahaprabhu is dancing and chanting in front of the chariot on the day of Rathayatra, He will become senseless, overwhelmed with <i>asta-sattvika vikar, </i>the eight symptoms of ecstasy. At that time, when He falls down with no sense, you will go in the dress of a devotee and massage His feet and chant these <i>slokas</i> from <i>Srimad-Bhagavatam."</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">King Prataparudra followed his advice, and one of the slokas was:</p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p3"><b>tava kathamrtam tapta jivanam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>		<p class="p3"><b>kavibhir iditam kalmasapanam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>		<p class="p3"><b>sravana mangalam srimad atatam</b></p>		<p class="p3"><b>bhuvi grnanti ye bhurida janah</b></p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p3">["O, Krishna, the nectar of Your words and the narrations of Your Pastimes give life to us, who are always suffering in this material world. This nectar is broadcast all over the world by great souls, and it removes all sinful reactions. It is all-auspicious and filled with spiritual power. Those who spread this message of Godhead are certainly doing the greatest relief work for human society and are the most magnanimous welfare workers." <br>            <i>(SB, 10.31.9) Translation taken from Sri Guru and His Grace.]</i></p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">When he recited this <i>sloka, </i>Mahaprabhu embraced him, saying <i>"Bhuridah, bhuridah!" 'Bhuridah'</i> means who is the most generous, who is the greatest donor in this world, and that person is our best friend. And whoever is distributing the Krishna<i>-katha</i> all over the world is the greatest donor, <i>'bhuridah'.</i> Mahaprabhu embraced the King saying, "Oh you are the most magnanimous, because you are distributing Krishna consciousness."</p>		<p class="p2"><br>		  </p>		<p class="p1">Some people say, "Oh, who is giving some shirt, giving some pants—he is the great donor." Some institutions are telling, "We are giving some medicine, so we are great donors." But who is the greatest donor? Srila Param Guru Maharaj (Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj) told one time, "Sometimes when the flood is coming some local men come to me, 'Maharaj, you have a big temple, why are you not giving some donation to us for the flood victims?' " Param Guru Maharaj replied, "What we are giving to the <i>jiva</i> souls all over the world is the highest thing; whoever takes this will not suffer in his life such things as floods."</p>		<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>		<p class="p1"><i>Bhuvi grnanti ye bhurida janah,</i> those who are distributing the Krishna-<i>katha</i> are the greatest donors in this world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>				</blockquote>      </div>      </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>      <hr>      <div align="left"><font class="list"> </font>                      <div align="center"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="small-reference"><ahref="../../../new.html">What's New?</a> | <a href="../../../contact_us.html">Contact us</a> | <a href="../../../downloads.html">Useful Downloads</a> | <a href="../../../centers.html">Centres</a> </span></font></div>      </div>       <div align="center" class="small-reference"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This website is &copy; Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math,         Nabadwip.<br>        Founder-Acharyya: Srila B.
