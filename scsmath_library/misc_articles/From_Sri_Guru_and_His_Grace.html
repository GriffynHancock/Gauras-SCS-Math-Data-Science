            err is human. To err is inevitable for all, being not perfect. Still, 
            no one wants to remain imperfect. There is an element within all that 
            is animate that tends towards perfection. If it were not so, we would 
            feel no want at all. Our tendency towards perfection is certainly 
            very weak and limited, otherwise we could attain the goal at once. 
            Our limited capacity and tendency for perfection makes room for the 
            guide or guru. </font>

              imperfect is not so if it is not in need of help, and that also 
              from beyond itself. The perfect is not perfect if He cannot assert 
              Himself or help others, and that too, of His own accord. So the 
              guidance to perfection or Absolute Truth is necessarily a function 
              of the Absolute Himself, and the Divine Agent through whom this 
              function manifests is Sri Guru, or the Divine Guide. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>F</b>or 
              a seeker of the Absolute Truth, submission to the guru is unavoidable. 
              A class of thinkers believes, however, that when scientific research 
              is possible, why cannot higher spiritual knowledge also be evolved 
              from within? Such people are ignorant of the most essential nature 
              of Absolute Knowledge - that He alone is the Absolute Subject, and 
              all else, including ourselves, constitutionally stand only as an 
              object to His omniscient vision. It is impossible for the eye to 
              see the mind; it can have some connection with the mind only when 
              the latter cares to mind it. In a similar way, our connection with 
              Absolute Knowledge depends mainly on His sweet will. We must solely 
              depend on His agent, or the Spiritual Master, through whom He likes 
              to distribute Himself. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>O</b>ur 
              human society -- with its finest culture -- forms but an infinitesimal 
              part of the dynamic Absolute. How, except by the direct and positive 
              method of revelation, dare we hope to comprehend or evolve any conception 
              of the supernatural knowledge of the unconditioned Infinite? All 
              intellectual giants prove themselves but pygmies before the Absolute 
              Omniscient Omnipotence who reserves the right to give Himself away 
              through His own agents alone. </font>

              our best knowledge and sincerity, however, we should see not to 
              submit to a false agent. Here of course, we can't help ourselves 
              very much, because in our present state we are mainly guided by 
              our previous <i>samskara,</i> or acquired nature. "Birds of the 
              same feather flock together." Yet, although we are generally overpowered 
              by habit, there is still the possibility of free choice to a certain 
              extent, especially in the human species, otherwise correction becomes 
              impossible, and punishment mere vengeance. Reality can assert itself. 
              Light does not require darkness for its positive proof. The sun 
              by itself can establish its supremacy over all other lights. Before 
              an open and unbiased eye, the <font color="#666666">sad guru</font> 
              [real guide] shines above all professors of phenomenon. </font>

              Guru manifests himself mainly in a twofold way -- as the director 
              from within, and the preceptor from without. Both functions of the 
              Absolute help an individual soul, a disciple, to reach the absolute 
              goal. In our fallen state we cannot catch the proper direction of 
              the inner guide, so the merciful manifestation of the preceptor 
              without is our sole help and hope. But at the same time, it is only 
              by the grace of the guru within that we can recognize the real preceptor 
              without, and submit to his holy feet. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>A</b> 
              bona fide disciple must always remain fully awake to the fact that 
              his highest spiritual fortune is but a gracious grant from the Absolute 
              Lord, and not a matter of right to be demanded or fought out. Constitutionally, 
              we are equipped only to be proper recipients of God's favor. In 
              this connection, it should be clearly understood that an individual 
              soul can never be substantially the same as the Absolute Person. 
              Not even in his liberated or fully realized condition can an individual 
              soul be one with Godhead. The misconception of oneness has been 
              introduced from the slothful nondiscrimination of the Absolute Personality 
              from the luminous orb around His eternal, spiritual, and blissful 
              home. In fact, an individual soul constitutes only a part of a particular 
              power of intermediate value of the Supreme Lord, and as such he 
              is capable of being converted from both sides. He differs from the 
              Absolute Entity both in quantity and quality, and is merely a dependent 
              entity on the Absolute. In other words, the Absolute Lord Krishna 
              is the Master, and an individual jiva soul is His constitutional 
              subordinate, or servant. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>S</b>uch 
              a relationship is constant and really wholesome for the jiva. The 
              apprehension of slavery does not arise, because of his free choice 
              and immense positive gain. The freedom and individuality of the 
              jiva are not only unharmed by surrender to the Absolute Good, but 
              they really thrive in Him alone. Individual freedom and interest 
              are the part and parcel of those who are of the Absolute, and so 
              they are quite at home there, as a fish is at home in water or an 
              animal in a healthy atmosphere. But the freedom, as well as all 
              other qualities of the Supreme Personality, are unlimited and transcendental, 
              and so only by their partial functions they harmonize all relative 
              entities. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>S</b>ri 
              Guru is not exclusively the same as the Supreme Lord Himself, but 
              he fully represents the essence of the whole normal potency, and 
              embodies the most comprehensive and excellent service and favor 
              of the Lord. As he is the fittest servitor of the Lord, he is empowered 
              by the Lord to reinstate all misguided souls to their best interest. 
              So, Guru is the Divine Messenger of immortal hope and joy in this 
              mortal and miserable world. His advent is the most auspicious and 
              happy event to the suffering animation, and can be compared to the 
              rising of the morning star that can guide the traveller lost in 
              the desert. A gentle touch of Sri Guru's merciful hand can wipe 
              off the incessant tears from all weeping eyes. A patriot or philanthropist 
              makes the problem only worse in his frantic and futile attempt to 
              alleviate the deep rooted pain of a suffering soul, as an ignorant 
              doctor does in eagerly handling an unfortunate patient. O the day 
              when this poor soul realizes the causeless grace of Sri Gurudev.
