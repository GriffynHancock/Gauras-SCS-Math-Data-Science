          <p>When Prahlad reached the age for learning, around four, Hiranyakasipu 
            gave him to his Guru's asram. As he was the king's son, he was to 
            be trained as a king. The Guru was Sukracharyya. In his house he had 
            two sons, one was called Sanda and the other Amarka. Sanda and Amarka 
            were taking care of Prahlad, as he lived in the Guru's house. </p>

        <p class=body align=justify>Prahlad was so qualified in the Krsna conception 
          that when he was there he was always thinking of Krsna and preaching 
          to his friends, the other boys, on the Krsna conception. After one year, 
          Hiranyakasipu was thinking that his son had learnt something, maybe 
          ABCD, etc. He then called Sanda and Amarka to bring his son into the 
          assembly, "I want to see my son." They brought Prahlad, and Hiranyakasipu 
          took Prahlad on his lap and gave him much affection. He then asked Prahlad, 
          "Please tell me what you have learned in your Gurudeva's school. Maybe 
          it is ABCD or anything." But Prahlad was thinking that his Guru was 
          Narada Goswami and he told Hiranyakasipu the lesson that he learned 
          from Narada: </p>
        <p class=body align=left><b>tat sadhu manye 'sura-varya dehinam <br>

          (Srimad-Bhagavatam 7.5.5) </p>
        <p class=body align=justify>Prahlad said, "I learned from my Guru that 
          it is very good for everyone to leave mundane attachment, go to the 
          jungle and worship Lord Krsna. That is very good, I think." </p>
        <P class=body align=justify> Hiranyakasipu heard this and exclaimed, "What 
          are you saying? You are telling us to worship Visnu." Prahlad said, 
          "Yes, father, this is the best. Be detached with this material world, 
          and go to the jungle and worship Lord Visnu." Hiranyakasipu was very 
          angry with Prahlad's teachers and chastised them very much. </P>
        <P class=body align=justify>"You taught this to my son! Take him back 
          and give him perfect lessons with perfect teachings. I shall call again 
          after one year and if I see anything wrong, then I shall punish you!" 
          Prahlad went back and Sanda and Amarka asked him, "Oh Prahlad, what 
          have you told your father? We did not teach that to you. We taught you 
          general knowledge, politics, many things, but we did not teach you this. 
          Where did you learn it?" Prahlad replied, "If I try to learn, I cannot 
          learn without the mercy of Lord Visnu. By His mercy and His devotees' 
          mercy; that is the only cause for getting that consciousness." </P>

          were chanting the Holy Name of Lord Visnu in the school and sometimes 
          from afar, Sanda and Amarka heard it. They were very angry but Prahlad 
          was the king's son so they could not beat him. They came and they told 
          him in several ways, "Do not do this, it is very dangerous, you do not 
          know. This whole school will be destroyed by Hiranyakasipu." Prahlad 
          would not hear from them and the other boys would also not hear from 
          them. Sanda and Amarka were very fearful. Then after two sittings of 
          the assembly and their failure to teach Prahlad, they told Hiranyakasipu, 
          "We are unable to teach him. His mind is completely crazy and he is 
          only giving advice to everyone. He has taken the chair of teacher and 
          is giving his teachings to the other demons' children. We cannot control 
          him, sir. Please excuse our offences." </P>
        <P class=body align=justify>Hiranyakasipu was very angry to hear that. 
          In the meantime he tried to give some teachings but it was not appropriate 
          for Prahlad. Finally he wanted to kill Prahlad. He told his servants, 
          "Take him and throw him from the mountain." They threw Prahlad from 
          the mountain but Visnu saved him. "Throw him in the ocean." They threw 
          him in the ocean and again Visnu saved him. They tried to kill him in 
          many different ways. They threw him in a well, but he was saved. They 
          put him in front of a mad elephant, thinking that the mad elephant would 
          smash him. But the elephant took Prahlad to his head and the elephant 
          began to dance. </P>

                adverse circumstances may come to disturb us we should try to 
                not only see them as opposing and undesirable but we are required 
                to see them as quite befitting: "It should come and is coming 
                through the will of my good, well-wishing Lord. Very kindly He 
                is sending these apparently unfavorable things to me but here 
                is His grace." We shall try to read positive sympathy in the pain 
                and not only negative opposition. One thing to note is that nothing 
                can come without His sanction, so it is coming to me with His 
                sanction. There can be no spirit of retaliation in Him, therefore 
                the pain has come for some purpose: to purify me. This positive 
                end is there. He is trying to finish the bad consequences of my 
                previous actions. "I would otherwise have had to undergo the bad 
                consequences of my actions for a long time to come but perhaps 
                He is making that intense in order to be finished within a very 
                short time. Therefore it is His grace." If with this attitude 
                we can face this danger that surrounds us then very easily we 
                are released from all such opposing forces.</font></i> </p>
