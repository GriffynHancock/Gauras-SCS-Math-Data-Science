        a beautiful song, Srila Thakur Bhaktivinoda prays to attain the pure vision 
        of the Dham: <i>Dhamera svarupa, sphuribe nayane. </i>His Divine Grace 
        Srila B.R. Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj says that without this pure vision 
        "the Dham may appear quite ordinary to us, like a jungle." Srila Guru 
        Maharaj tells us that the Supreme Lord is everywhere, but His "concentrated 
        existence," His special intensity, is found in the Holy Dham. When our 
        pure vision, or our real eye awakens we will be able to see, feel and 
        appreciate the transcendental quality of the Holy Abode.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By 
        the mercy of Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga we are now here in the holy land 
        of Sridham Nabadwip. Unfortunately, I have no eye to see the true Nabadwip, 
        but fortunately, I am here under the care and shelter of the Vaisnavas. 
        Following their devotional example I feel there is some safety and some 
        sweet hope. In Sri Nabadwip, even the external cover has a luminous beauty. 
        Thomas Merton once said, "There is in all things an inexhaustible sweetness 
        and purity." Certainly this is true in Nabadwip Dham, the place of Sri 
        Gaurahari's divine Pastimes. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="050124_HolyDham-folder/giriraj-mandir-140x.jpg" width="140" height="167" align="right" border="1" vspace="4" hspace="4">Early 
        each morning the bells from Sri Sada-Siva Gangadhar's Mandir ring and 
        invite the devotees to the first arati of the day. Next, the pujari boards 
        the small boat and floats across the holy waters of Sri Govinda Kunda 
        to reach the Temple of Sri Giriraj which stands, in the pre-light of this 
        early hour, like a celestial island wrapped in white fog. Following Sri 
        Giriraj's arati we cross the dark road to give obeisance and join the 
        arati offered to His Divine Grace Srila Param Guru Maharaj. Then on to 
        bow down before Their Lordships Sri Sri Guru Gauranga Gandharva Govindasundarjiu 
        and attend Their beautiful arati ceremony. The devotees perform parikrama 
        and as the morning darkness fades they offer prayers to Tulasi Devi and 
        the Vaisnavas.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If 
        it is a clear morning, and if I time it just right, I am able to begin 
        parikrama around Sri Govinda Kunda in time to see the saffron globe of 
        the sun float into the sky from the dark horizon. For a few brief moments 
        its golden light is framed by the doors of Sri Giriraj's Mandir. By this 
        time the birds surrounding Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math are awake and singing 
        happily in the kadamba tree and the long sweet day stretches before us 
        in this Holy Abode. After the previous day's rainfall the monkeys are 
        active and mischievous. Last night they broke several of the clay flower 
        pots surrounding Sri Govinda Kunda. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="050124_HolyDham-folder/govinda-kund-flowers140x.jpg" width="140" height="105" align="right" border="1" vspace="4" hspace="4">The 
        surrounding gardens have been planted with hundreds of flower plants that 
        are just now becoming ready to bloom. By Sri Gaura Purnima the gardens 
        will be fragrant and covered with colourful flowers. This morning, the 
        dahlias are the early bloomers and I wonder how many lifetimes, how many 
        forms they have taken before reaching this glorious birth in Sri Nabadwip. 
        Srila Guru Maharaj says that in the Dham "all are in a serving attitude 
        whether birds, beasts, worms, insects &#151; everything &#151; all are 
        contributing to the Reality." These flowers are now opening, stretching 
        for the light as if offering themselves. Every morning I pick two perfect 
        and brilliant dahlias and bring them to the pujari, Bhudev Prabhu, and 
        every morning when the Deities' doors open, Srimati Gandharva is holding 
        the dahlias in her perfect flower-like hands. </font></p>

        at the Math it is quiet. Two large preaching parties are travelling from 
        village to village holding programmes and collecting grains for Sri Gaura 
        Purnima. Workers are continuing daily on the new prasadam hall construction 
        here. Painters have assembled scaffolding all the way to the top of the 
        main Mandir and have begun painting the dome and chakra with fresh white 
        paint and pink lotus accents. All the servitors and guests at Sri Chaitanya 
        Saraswat Math are continuously asking after the health of our beloved 
        Srila Govinda Maharaj and they are constantly missing his immediate divine 
        presence.<br>

        Nabadwip Dham's fourth annual 'Sri Chaitanya Boi Mela' &#151; the Nabadwip 
        Book Fair &#151; has just concluded after eight days. This was the third 
        year that Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math has had a book stall at this event 
        which draws thousands of local residents and several well-known classical 
        Indian musicians and singers. Sripad Bhakti Nirmal Acharyya Maharaj had 
        arranged to have the name of His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Sundar Govinda 
        Dev-Goswami Maharaj along with the name of Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math 
        printed boldly on either side the main entrance gate to the fair.<br>

        Bhakti Nandan Narayan Maharaj from Mauritius and Jadu Gopal Prabhu from 
        our Nabadwip Math distributed books to sincere seekers. Surrounded by 
        the books of our divine Sri Guru-varga, I was reminded of the story of 
        how Sri Jiva Goswami sent Sri Srinivas Acharyya, Sri Narottama and Syamananda 
        Prabhu from Vrindavan to Bengal with the books written by the Goswamis. 
        Armed guards were hired to protect the precious cargo of books. As the 
        party approached the town of Vana Vishnupur, the greedy ruler of that 
        town hired thieves to steal what he had heard was a chest filled with 
        a most priceless treasure. When the king opened the chest he found only 
        books covered with valuable cloths. It is said that when he saw Sri Rupa 
        Goswami's pearl-like handwriting on the books the king was immediately 
        freed from past sins and his heart was purified and filled with divine 
        love. Remembering this story I am thinking that the public must be greatly 
        benefited just by seeing here the Math's holy books on display.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Each 
        moment in<b><i> </i></b>Sri Nabadwip is so full and slow and drenched 
        in sweetness. But my time here has gone too fast. Morning classes with 
        Sripad Narayan Maharaj and Hari Charan Prabhu have discussed and reminded 
        us about the fragility of this human form. Each passing year, month, day 
        and second brings us closer to the end of this body. Sripad Tirtha Maharaj 
        reminded us how Srila Guru Maharaj advised that we "be a miser with your 
        time." Not to waste these allotted minutes &#151; this flicker of life. 
        We cannot predict how many days we will have in this body or in this world, 
        but somehow we have been graced with the opportunity of sadhu-sanga and 
        sadhu-seva. Without these, we actually do not care for a long life.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Srila 
        Guru Maharaj said, "I am meant for my ideal. I have no time to waste, 
        or to hesitate for anything. If every moment I move in every way with 
        the ideal in my heart, I shall always make some progress towards it. If 
        I can just stay in touch with my ideal, that will guide and inspire me. 
        In any and every action, whatever I shall do or undo, eat, rest, etc., 
        my ideal will be overhead. And that will gradually take me out of all 
        these entanglements and enticements, and one day or other I shall be able 
        to reach it."</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now 
        it is evening time in the Dham. Many guests have come to visit the beauty 
        of Sri Govinda Kunda and attend arati. The blue of the sky has deepened 
        and the moon and stars have risen to compete with the lights above the 
        Mandirs. I am ending here because the sweet kirttans are now beginning 
        in the nat-mandir.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
        am offering my heartfelt obeisance to all the steady servitors here at 
        Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math, Nabadwip. Their constant service activities 
        are surely the outward signs of their inner grace. </font></p>
