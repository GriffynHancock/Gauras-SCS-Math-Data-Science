It gives a more favourable         opportunity for Krishna-Seva and it is a particularly favourable opportunity         for the fortunate jivas. Purusottam Month has all good qualities, just         like Bhagavan Purusottam, Himself, and is considered the crown of all         months. Even the most holy months such as Vaisak Month, cannot be compared         with this Purusottam Month. Bhagavan, the Lord Himself, has mercifully         accepted this month and given it all His power. We know such things by         reading Sri Brihannaradiya Purana.<br>        <br>        The materialistic smarta-sampradaya by their karmik standard of judgement         avoid performing rituals during this month and they avoid anything considered         materially auspicious. By their calculation this extra month is materially         barren or gloomy.<br>        <br>        In Srimad Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that if we do karma properly then         we gain some capacity to enter within jnana. </font></p>      <blockquote>         <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>sarvam karmakhilam           partha<br>          jnane parisamapyate</b></font></p>      </blockquote>      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But         the fruit of that knowledge, the knower and the known are all nirvisesa,         or similar to mukti.<br>        <br>        By doing holy activities we may be able to attain heaven, but after finishing         that good reaction, we return to this world known as Martya-loka the plain         of death. In this way those who aspire for material things have to undergo         reactions to their actions.<br>        <br>        The devotees of Krishna, however, are worshipers of &quot;kirttaniyah         sada harih.&quot; Their process of worshiping is given in Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta:</font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>nijabhista krsna-prestha           pacheta' lagiya<br>          nirantara seva kare antarmana hana</b></font></p>      </blockquote>      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They         are twenty-four hours per day engaged for the Service of the Lord, for         they do not have a moment for their own sense enjoyment. They cannot tolerate         those who are against doing Seva, especially those who want some result         in this world. When they see these types of jivas they dislike them more         than hell. We can see many Scriptural examples of this.<br>        <br>        Similarly the worshipers of svaguna, the plane within the modes of nature,         always show their objection to those who are worshipers of the nirguna         &#151; the realm above the modes of nature. There is no lack of Scriptural         examples here also.<br>        <br>        The smartas, those under the rules of mundane nature, their material duties         are already scheduled within the regular twelve months so they dismiss         this extra month. However those who continually spend their time in worship         and service of the Lord give much attention to this month. They know fruitive         activity is a cause of material bondage. However those who desire material         results from fruitive activity consider this month to be barren, to be         materially unhealthy. Such persons dismiss this month, therefore this         extra month feels it is rejected so it feels the necessity to surrender         to its Master. The Lord always gives much protection to the surrendered,         so He gives all His own wealth and property to this month and in this         way it takes on His properties and becomes like Him. Therefore the Lord         gave His own Name, Purusottam, making this extra month the king of all         months. He Himself glorified this month and gave it to the hand of His         most dear devotees whom He loves as Himself. The devotees serve the Lord         Goloka Bihari Purusottam very happily in this Purusottam Month, the month         when the materialists are very silent in their activities.</font></p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td>       <p align="right"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#333333">Bengali         article of Srila B.R.
