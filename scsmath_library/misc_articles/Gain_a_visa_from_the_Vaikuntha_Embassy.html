      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../../new/images_whatsnew_04a/040223goswami_mj_127x.jpg" width="100" height="80" vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" border="1">You 
        may know in a general sense, that when you have an embassy it is actually 
        considered that country <i>within </i>your country. You have no jurisdiction 
        over there; it is actually their place. So, the American Embassy here 
        is, for all intents and purposes, America, so within there everything 
        is done that way, <i>their</i> way, and their citizens can seek refuge 
        there. If you want to go to America you can go there and approach for 
        a visa. So, it is really a good analogy. Sometimes Srila Guru Maharaj 
        said that that is what he was noted for: his use of analogy, giving original, 
        accessible concepts. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
        are told that the classic reference to the concept of analogy is <i>sakha-chandra-nyaya: 
        </i>the logic of seeing the moon through the branches of a tree. Like 
        here sometimes, even yesterday, when everyone was circumambulating, a 
        child asks, &quot;Where is the moon?&quot; and everyone is looking and 
        then, just like that example, you point to the branches of a particular 
        tree because the tree is near you and local. And then you say &quot;You 
        see that tree?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;You see the branch on the 
        left hand side?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Follow that branch. You see 
        right at the very end, the moon is there!&quot; &quot;Oh Yes! I see it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        the example is not the truth or the proof. In that case the tree is not 
        what is to be revealed; rather the moon through the agency of the use 
        of the tree is a graphic illustration. It is something that is immediate 
        and accessible to something more distant. This is its incredible power. 
        In this case, let's say the moon is about 400,000 kilometres away from 
        the earth, it's 240,000 miles according to NASA, but to locate that object 
        the tree which is three feet (one metre) away can be used to help us focus 
        on that. This is the beauty, the grace, the <i>mercy</i>, if you will, 
        of analogy.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
        is very useful for us who live next to the tree. So it is an extension, 
        but interestingly, <i>vaikunthera prthivy-adi sakala chinmaya (C.c. Adi 
        5.53)</i>, Vaikuntha is constructed out of consciousness. It is a conscious 
        construct, and not simply <i>generic </i>consciousness, which lies on 
        its outskirts, but <i>dedicating</i> consciousness, devotion. This propels 
        the development there. Dedicating substance. So those souls who possess 
        a particular type of dedication are extensions of that plane, and moving 
        within this world they make it accessible to us.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At 
        a time when there is a lot of discussion about 'Guru,' of which there 
        will always be, but talking particularly about initiating Gurus and such, 
        Srila Guru Maharaj pointed out that really this is the function of <i>madhyam 
        adhikari.</i> It is most accessible from that plane. He gave an example 
        when he said that three types of Guru we can conceive. Not three types 
        of Vaisnava he said, but three types of Guru. The first has two feet within 
        the spiritual world, the land of dedication, and he extends one here. 
        So he has one there and has extended one here, and he is taking from here 
        to there by dint of his connection locally. People are imbibing that sort 
        of divine substance. A similar sort of dedication is awakening within 
        their hearts, and that current, the whole movement of it, is drawing them 
        towards the domain that he has descended from. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Another 
        type of Guru has recently achieved a connection there, so he has also 
        got one foot here and one foot there but in a sort of reverse way. But 
        he is also qualified to take from here to there.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And 
        then he said, a third category we may conceive. And Srila Guru Maharaj 
        said this in many different ways but once he said, &quot;Two feet in the 
        mud!&quot; Like that, to underscore this clearly. He said, &quot;But his 
        eyes are fixed on Vaikuntha.&quot; <i>Brahma-nistham</i>. Still, he is 
        fixed in that conception, in saying, &quot;Oh, let us go there.&quot; 
        So he is in the progressive line of devotion. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Srila 
        Guru Maharaj also told us we may conceive of <i>swarupa siddhi</i> and 
        <i>vastu siddhi</i>. <i>Jivera swarupa haya, Krsna nitya dasa.</i> <i>Jiva</i> 
        by constitution <i>is</i> eternally the slave of Krishna. That is our 
        position. So for one who is qualified in that conception, <i>swarupa siddhi,</i> 
        but not yet posted in <i>lila, vastu siddhi,</i> from that position Bhaktivinoda 
        Thakur tells us deviation is still possible. How can we understand that? 
        Just as someone may possess the qualifications to be a judge, but not 
        yet be sitting in a court giving their opinions.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> janma karma 
          cha me divyam<br>
          evam yo vetti tattvatah<br>
          tyaktva deham punar janma<br>
          naiti mam eti so 'rjuna</b><i><br>
          (Gita 4:9)</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
        is indicated by Visvanath Chakravarti and others that the <i>prapancha 
        lila</i> is the first entrance point. So those souls who are qualified, 
        <i>Gopi janma garbha deho,</i> as Krishna's Pastimes are going from universe 
        to universe to universe to universe, they'll take birth from a Gopi in 
        that plane, and be introduced to the <i>lila</i> there.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But 
        meanwhile back on earth, by dint of their presence, is a 'Vaikuntha Embassy' 
        and depending upon the type of devotion they possess is what they are 
        an extension <i>of</i> and what they are giving entrance<i> to</i>. This 
        is why the position of Guru is so exclusive.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
        Devotee: </b>So the entrance is never the same? Each Guru has one door?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
        Sripad Goswami Maharaj: </b>Well, no. There is a line. This is the <i>Rupanuga 
        Sampradaya.</i> Rupa Raghunath. Rupa Sanatan. Entrance to a particular 
        plane, but that plane is broad and all encompassing: many possibilities 
        are there. But there is some hierarchy of servitors, so it is not that 
        each is taking to a different place, but what I mean to say, for example 
        Srila Guru Maharaj tells us that, &quot;Ramanuja discovered Vaikuntha.&quot; 
        Exploring the realm of consciousness, he discovered Vaikuntha and revealed 
        that to the world. Then there is a line of descent from him, but in our 
        Chaitanya Saraswat conception Srila Guru Maharaj is highlighting the conception 
        of Mahaprabhu that has come down to Srila Saraswati Thakur and his followers: 
        those who are following his particular line which is exclusive dedication 
        to the lotus feet of Rupa Goswami, Sri Rupa Manjari. <i>That </i>is the 
        plane he is representing, that is the type of devotional connection that 
        is being extended. They are cent percent servitors of the lotus feet of 
        Srimati Radharani always promoting Her, and not seeking self promotion.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So, 
        sometimes Srila Guru Maharaj told us, &quot;Having a passport is not enough.&quot; 
        That means a generic connection with Krishna consciousness. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Someone 
        can show up at the border of any country and say, &quot;I have a passport,&quot; 
        but that is not their concern. They expect that you have a passport, but 
        they are going to look within that passport to see if you have a <i>visa</i>. 
        Even though you've made it there, they want to see that somewhere locally 
        you were given permission, by their local agent. There are some people 
        who even after years and years and years of being in connection with the 
        Krishna consciousness movement have failed to offer themselves at the 
        lotus feet of Guru or Vaisnava seeking admittance, initiation.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Srila 
        Guru Maharaj told us, &quot;Three types we can conceive: Guru-<i>sevi, 
        </i>Guru-<i>bhogi, </i>and Guru-<i>tyagi. </i>Guru-<i>sevi,</i> serving 
        Guru; Guru-<i>bhogi,</i> enjoying the assets of Guru; and Guru-<i>tyagi,</i> 
        rejecting Guru.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He 
        said, &quot;But all three have connection with Guru.&quot; Then he told 
        us, &quot;But there is a fourth that is the worst: no necessity of Guru!&quot; 
        Even in the cases mentioned before, we too may find something undesirable, 
        but connection with Guru is there, but then there is this other category: 
        'no need for Guru.'</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        this is the point: the local agent. Long before you get to that country 
        you will out of necessity have approached the embassy and by the local 
        agents there have been examined and approved for admission into the country. 
        It is a perfect analogy. So here, moving in this plane are those making 
        <i>that</i> plane accessible, but some examination will be there.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Suka 
        became the examiner of Pariksit although Pariksit was an examiner by name. 
        But it is that perfect that in the midst of so much disparity and difference 
        of opinion coming to Pariksit Maharaj, &quot;This is the way!&quot; <i>&quot;Tapasya!&quot; 
        &quot;Dhyana!&quot; &quot;Jnana!&quot;</i> Everyone telling him what to 
        do according to what they can perceive, when they're under the influence, 
        how to navigate. But why take direction from men whose vision is impaired? 
        He is there in the midst of all this but moving towards him is Sukadev. 
        So, in the midst of our lives' circumstances so many voices are pulling 
        us. The Lord's agents are moving as by divine will, grace, mercy, towards 
        us to come and rescue us. And that Sukadev is very beautifully described:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>parinisthito 
          'pi nairgunya, uttama-sloka-lilaya<br>
          grhita-cheta rajarse, akhyanam yad adhitavan</b><i><br>
          (Bha 2.1.9)</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> He 
        is the <i>perfect</i> mouthpiece for what Pariksit Maharaj needs to hear. 
        We need to understand that when Krishna appears to us, before us, as Sri 
        Guru it is precisely, perfectly, divinely, designed and destined for our 
        inner necessity. So we were discussing <i>nirguna,</i> and he says <i>&quot;Parinisthito 
        'pi nairgunya</i> I was totally situated on the other side of the <i>saguna</i> 
        plane.&quot; And that set him apart from everybody else, because all the 
        others were struggling to overcome this, and saying &quot;This is helpful, 
        that is helpful, this will be good, ....&quot; But everyone knew Sukadev 
        was never under the material influence from <i>before</i> his birth. So 
        he had some outstanding qualifications that were recognised by everybody 
        else. &quot;Oh this is that Sukadev that we've heard about; let us hear 
        what he has to say.&quot; Because they know that what they are suffering 
        from in varying degrees is not for a moment, not even remotely, the same 
        for him. And when he says <i>&quot;Parinisthito 'pi nairgunya,</i> I was 
        totally situated in the <i>nirguna</i> plane,&quot; no one has any doubts 
        about that. So here are all these <i>saguna</i> qualities, and he is in 
        the <i>nirguna</i> plane. This means <i>brahmavad,</i> basically. Hasn't 
        become qualified yet, it's <i>nirguna,</i> it's the outskirts: but it 
        is above here. So he is happily there. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Then 
        he says, <i>&quot;grhita-cheta rajarse.... parinisthito 'pi nairgunya 
        uttama-sloka-lilaya.&quot; </i>Then these <i>slokas,</i> these conscious 
        gems appeared, &quot;Hearing them I heard about Krishna-<i>lila,</i> and 
        I was unaware of that! I was in the <i>nirguna</i> plane, above all these 
        undesirable mundane qualities, but not knowing anything about the super-qualified 
        plane above that, just <i>nirguna.</i> But then I am hearing this <i>uttama-sloka-lilaya</i> 
        and my consciousness is being captured and carried away into another plane 
        that I didn't know existed previously, because I was in <i>Brahma. Nirguna,</i> 
        but not deep; on the surface of the <i>nirguna</i> world, where it appears 
        without any sort of qualities. But then I started hearing all kinds of 
        qualities but they were unlike the qualities here that will drag you down 
        to become involved in this plane. My heart was being carried away into 
        another domain, another dimension, <i>grhita-cheta rajarse</i>.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And 
        then he says, what was that that he heard, that had this sort of influence 
        upon him? Krishna-<i>lila.</i> So:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> vikriditam vraja-vadhubhir 
          idam cha visnoh <br>

          hrd-rogam asv apahinoty achirena dhirah</b><i><br>
          (Bha 10:33:39)</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What 
        type of faith is required to hear Krishna-<i>lila,</i> and specifically 
        Krishna's Pastimes? </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> kam prati kathayitum 
          ise<br>
          samprati ko va pratitim ayatu<br>
          go-pati-tanaya-ku&ntilde;je<br>
          gopa-vadhuti-vitam brahma</b><i><br>
          (C.c. Madhya 19:98)</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Who 
        will believe this? Who is qualified to hear it, and who will believe it?&quot; 
        For various reasons Sukadev is very cautious in his presentation to this 
        group. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        those in the embassy have varying levels of qualification. They may know 
        the full wealth of their country and all its secrets, and they may not. 
        <i>Vyaso vetti na vetti va.( C.c. Madhya 24:315.)</i> But they are agents 
        providing connections issuing visas for entrance. So when Srila Gurudev 
        is giving Harinama Mahamantram, still to this day he will say, &quot;I 
        have been ordered by my Guru to distribute the seeds of Krishna-<i>prema</i> 
        to sincere seekers.&quot; <i>Bhakti lata bija.</i> The conceptual <i>seed,</i> 
        the Krishna conceptual seed which is nourished by association and service. 
        But entrance to this plane is different to what we normally conceive of. 
        Most typically in this world someone wants to go somewhere to enjoy that 
        place it will be beneficial to them to either visit there or establish 
        some sort of residency and reap the benefits. But here, <i>pranipatena:</i> 
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> tad viddhi pranipatena<br>
          pariprasnena sevaya<br>
          upadeksyanti tad jnanam<br>
          jnaninas tattva darsinah</b><i><br>
          (Gita 4:34)</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        the qualification for admittance there is the desire to offer oneself 
        in service. As was pointed out the other day: what is the offer? The finite 
        offers itself to receive the Infinite. It is easy to <i>express </i>in 
        that way.<b> </b><i>Diksha-kale bhakta kare atma-samarpana (C.c. Antya 
        4:191).</i> Otherwise we are giving the appearance of initiation, the 
        formality, the ritual of it all. But we cannot sit before Srila Bhakti 
        Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami here at his <i>Viraha-Milan Samadhi</i> and 
        ever entertain the idea that form will take precedence over substance. 
        <i>Vastu. Vastavam atra vastu sivadam tapa-trayonmulanam (Bha 1:1:2). 
        </i>So we are making a feeble attempt to live in the conscious plane and 
        in the association of those Vaisnavas that shall elevate our consciousness, 
        even imperceptibly perhaps. It is written in <i>Sri Chaitanya Bhagavat</i> 
        that where there is a <i>Maha-bhagavata,</i> a devotee of the first order, 
        that we were talking about overlapping areas of radiance or divine mercy 
        it says something to the effect that the aura or their <i>krpa</i> and 
        purifying radiance is something like 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles). So 
        that's far beyond the earth. That means if one is upon the earth the earth 
        is covered. The earth <i>is </i>the centre of the universe; actually it 
        <i>is</i> a geocentric conception. If we can get the right perspective, 
        we will see the earth is in the centre and everything is pivoting around 
        that. Naimisaranya! But we have to stop conceiving things in terms of 
        finite, and making finite 'what if?' forecasts, finite 'what if?' projections. 
        Still we are buying into the same foolishness. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
        old joke was if you gave some monkeys typewriters and enough time they 
        would type the complete works of Shakespeare. Now I guess it's simians 
        with super computers: &quot;If there are enough simians with super computers, 
        they could produce the entire Vedas.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Stay 
        away from these people. They write on the board: &quot;The sum total of 
        the finite equals the infinite.&quot; They are in love with themselves 
        actually. Democracy: &quot;If enough asses 'braaaaay' in a particular 
        way then we'll accept that as the direction in which to proceed.&quot; 
        <i>Sva-vid-varaha ustra-kharaih.</i> </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        <i>one word from the Guru,</i> it is told, will outweigh, tip the scales. 
        One word from the Infinite. The Infinite is being broadcast into this 
        domain via the agency of the inspiration of Guru-Vaisnava. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Human 
        beings especially are meant to cultivate consciousness. We know that, 
        and that is not even a spiritual concept. Everybody knows it. Why? Why 
        do they know it intuitively? There are certain things we just sort of 
        get, intuitively. One of them is: as soon as possible, children should 
        be educated. Of course there are some people that are obsessing: in the 
        crib they have the alphabet hanging there, letters hanging in an alphabet 
        sky so that they can immediately begin their education. It means intuitively 
        they understand, this is across the spectrum, that human beings are meant 
        for some sort of inner culture. We get lost in our own jargon sometimes. 
        'This human form of life is meant for self realisation.' It says that 
        in the manual. But they know that. Everybody knows that!</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
        Devotee:</b> I have a question. You were talking about the <i>Ramayana</i> 
        yesterday, and that Srila Guru Maharaj was attracted to the <i>Ramayana</i> 
        conception before being introduced to Krishna consciousness. <i>Ramayana</i> 
        is within the Vaikuntha area conceptually, so is there gradation within 
        the Vaikuntha conception? And how does a person move between conceptions?</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
        Sripad Goswami Maharaj:</b> It is a very good question. In the very beginning 
        of the <i>Bhagavatam</i> he says: <i>vedanti tat tattva-vidas, tattvam 
        yaj jnanam advayam (Bha 1:2:11).</i> Actually it is only one. This substance 
        is one. But that's not the end of the story. Not that everyone says, &quot;Close 
        the book; let's go home, it's all one.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> No. 
        Hold on a minute! He's saying, &quot;That one substance we are now going 
        to talk about what is that one substance? Brahman, Paramatma, Bhagavan.&quot; 
        Brahma means this, Paramatma means that.... We are told: &quot;All-accommodating 
        Brahman, is larger than the largest. All-permeating Paramatma, is smaller 
        than the smallest, permeating everything. And now Bhagavan....&quot; And 
        in Bhagavan is the central conception of attraction. To spell it out really 
        simply, it means that Krishna, or Bhagavan, is attractive when accompanied 
        by His Potency. That's when He looks best and His real beauty comes out, 
        with Her by His side, and with interaction, Their <i>lila,</i> Their Pastimes.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        the Bhagavan conception is given here, and then it is going to be given 
        in gradation. We are told 'Visnu-<i>bhakti</i> of Vaikuntha' with infinite 
        variations on that theme. So we hear in <i>Sanatan-siksa</i> where Mahaprabhu 
        is telling Sanatan Goswami about all these different Visnu forms and how 
        he will understand Their Names by the placement of items in His hands. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We 
        can understand even in this world how people may superficially appear 
        to be the same but in fact no two people are identical looking, and we 
        can see shades of beauty, variation, and attractiveness in them. So what 
        to speak of Bhagavan. Can we allow that for Him, that He can also have 
        innumerable forms and variations on a particular theme of beauty, with 
        subtle shades of variation, a little emphasis here and something being 
        suppressed there, or understated here and augmented there? Why not? Except 
        when <i>He</i> does that, it is in infinite array! </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        through those quadruple expansions, then sixty-four Visnu forms, an idea 
        is being given how this expands and extends, and that is the Vaikuntha 
        world. Srila Guru Maharaj would say, &quot;And there we find two and a 
        half <i>rasas</i>.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This 
        is what I want to say as the foundation for this, on the God theme. It 
        is like money. There is a world of currency: dollars, euros, rupees, yen. 
        They are all money, and locally when we need some money and are in India 
        we think, &quot;I need some rupees.&quot; It is understood like that locally 
        money and rupees are synonymous. However to think that that is the extent 
        of it, that it doesn't go beyond that, or that there is no other system 
        of value anywhere else is provincial and foolish. So there is a standard 
        by which this plurality of currencies can be judged, and we will find 
        there is a location of dollars, and what is the assessed value of a euro, 
        a rupee, a yen, etc. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Similarly 
        when it comes to the God concept people provincially think that whatever 
        is available locally and that they have been raised on is all there is. 
        Whereas actually there is also a standard by which God concepts can be 
        measured and assessed as superior and inferior, and that standard is <i>rasa</i>. 
        <i>Rasa</i> is very difficult to translate from Sanskrit, but here we 
        can say for the sake of this argument it means 'loving intimacy.' The 
        intimacy of loving relationship. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 
        a general and broad sense, it is true that ninety-nine percent of religious 
        conceptions deal with Brahma. They may use words like mother, father, 
        sister, brother, but it's Brahma. <i>Brahmavad,</i> at best, and often 
        thoroughly coated with <i>mayavad.</i> All their concepts vanish in Brahma 
        in time. If you press their theologians deeper and deeper and deeper it 
        just starts sounding more and more like Brahma, in time. When they get 
        backed into a corner all the 'mother, father, sister, son' stuff starts 
        dissolving in Brahma.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anyway, 
        back to Vaikuntha and the variations to the theme, there are 'two and 
        a half <i>rasas.'</i> It means <i>santa rasa, dasya rasa,</i> and Srila 
        Guru Maharaj told for some servitors who have been there a really long 
        time (in a world that is not under the influence of time admittedly, but 
        so we have some idea!), some semblance of friendship starts entering that 
        relationship on some level. That is the spectrum of <i>rasa</i> within 
        Vaikuntha. When you are dealing with <i>rasa,</i> that actual substance, 
        then what could be better than this? </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When 
        we read in the <i>Bhagavatam</i> the descriptions of Vaikuntha, they are 
        utterly charming, seductive, and filled with beauty: the descriptions 
        of the terrain there, the lotuses, the palaces, the Visnu forms. When 
        Gopa Kumar is on the outskirts of Vaikuntha and he sees who appears to 
        be Visnu entering, he is giving his dandavat pranam and offering prayers, 
        but those devotees with their four arms were saying, &quot;No, no, we 
        are not Him!&quot; because they look like the Lord also. The Lord himself 
        however has that <i>srivatsa,</i> which is very hard to describe but in 
        one place is explained as like threads made out of jewels in front of 
        a mirror of jewels. So Gopa Kumar understood to be on the lookout for 
        that <i>srivatsa</i> to identify who is the Lord. In Nrsimha-loka the 
        devotees have forms like Him so much variegated position is there.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When 
        the heart's inner necessity to express itself in a particular way exceeds 
        the lower hemisphere of Vaikuntha, then it starts ascending towards Ayodhya.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
        Devotee:</b> Does that occur naturally or is help from above needed always?

        as Rama, and, <i>ye yatha Mam prapadyante</i> <i>(Gita 4:11).</i> This 
        is the beauty of it: it is mystical, because this is the general rule 
        of thumb of spiritual transaction. <i>Ye yatha Mam prapadyante, tams tathaiva

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What 
        is it within us that cringes at the word 'slavery'? I think it was so

        almost hear people saying, &quot;Oh Maharaj, don't say 'slave,' say 'servant,' 
        it sounds better.&quot; Even etymologically speaking the word <i>'dasa'</i>

        humanists that they accuse the Gaudiya Math of &quot;simply spreading 
        slavery and degradation. This is what with our enlightened thinking we 
        have tried to rescue people from. We are offering them democracy, where 
        they too have a voice.&quot; The voice of the asses/masses! The ass is 
        mass; the mass is ass. These people continue: &quot;The sum total of their 
        brains will express direction. That is what we have offered them through

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Srila

        is how perverted we have become, to conceive of intimate service to divinity 
        as being something degrading. That is absurd. It is sick that we conceive 
        service as unworthy.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When 
        Mahatma Gandhi sent out word that he needed an assistant, all the biggest 
        men of India volunteered for the job. Scientists, great thinkers, intellectuals, 
        millionaires everyone wanted to be Gandhi's assistant or servant or slave 
        or <i>anything</i> to get his association. They thought that, &quot;He 
        is a man of such qualification that I just want to be around him, doing 
        anything for him, handing him a glass of water, washing his clothes, turning 
        on the fan, shutting the windows or opening the door.&quot; </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        in different places devotees have accepted the most menial, objectionable 
        service, such as Isvara Puri and Narottama dasa Thakur, to show something 
        really extreme, to push our buttons and underscore this point. They are 
        doing what materially speaking are the most objectionable things. Why? 
        Because their conception, their estimation of what they are in connection 
        with is so high that these things are not objectionable but desirable. 
        Most desirable instead of most objectionable. There is an expression: 
        'A radical transformation.' And if ever one was called for, it is here

        very intense in their expression which reveals the exclusiveness of their 
        devotion and dedication. So Prabodananda Saraswati in the <i>Sri Chaitanya-chandramrta</i>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What 
        is his approach? He is saying to respectable, educated, literate, modern 
        people: &quot;You know so much. Who can estimate the depth of what you 
        know and understand, and what your position is? I am nothing by comparison, 
        but I know that because you <i>are</i> such exalted persons that I can 
        ask one small, humble favour or request, and you being such exalted magnanimous 
        souls will surely grant me that. So I am putting a straw between my teeth, 
        falling at your feet and submitting this one small, simple humble request.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And 
        what is that? &quot;Forget everything that you know! Take all of it and 
        throw it away! It's all 'yesterday.' Leave it. <i>Chaitanya-chandra-charane 
        kurutanuragam,</i> and kindly turn your attention to the lotus feet of 
        Mahaprabhu, where you will find inconceivable wealth. That is my request. 
        Humbly.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And 
        it is still our request of ourselves. What is it we think we know? It 
        is the gathered individual and collective experience of sense gathering, 
        that's all. What we've been able to verify or collect individually or 
        collectively as human beings, the sum total history of human civilisation, 
        all of that has to be left behind because whatever pull it has upon us 
        is keeping us anchored to <i>anartha, </i>to misconception. So only <i>grhita-cheta 
        rajarse. Uttama-sloka-lilaya,</i> our consciousness being captured by 
        the seed of faith planted there can start pulling us out of this situation. 
        It is the only means for us to connect to that Vaikuntha world. It is 
        real, it is substantial, but, <i>sraddha-mayo 'yam loka,</i> it is a plane 
        of faith; a faith signal is being broadcast into this domain. So many 
        times Srila Gurudev is saying, &quot;One has to make oneself a receiver.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
        reason Ayodhya is superior to Vaikuntha is that because there the Lord 
        has the Pastimes of being born, having a mother, father, brother and so 
        on. There is no 'birth' of Visnu and Laksmi in Vaikuntha, so those sort 
        of mother and father Pastimes are not there. These things are revealed 
        in Ayodhya. So generally Guru Maharaj is telling us that the Vaikuntha 
        world is the lower hemisphere of the spiritual domain, but now we are 
        going deeper and higher, into Ayodhya. There, there is also conjugal <i>seva,</i> 
        but it is restricted to Sita. Only She is qualified there for that type 
        of <i>seva.</i><br>
        <br>
        Interestingly though, when Ramachandra visits Mithila or other different 
        places, the Dandakaranya Rishis are seeing his inconceivable, extraordinary 
        beauty and are becoming imbued with <i>Madhura-rasa</i> sentiments. Some 
        gradation is taking place, but Lord Ramachandra is expressing, &quot;I 
        know how you feel, <i>but.</i>...&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 
        this <i>lila</i> He is so exclusively dedicated to Sita that in her absence, 
        when it became time for him to perform certain sacrifices that required 
        that the wife must be there with the husband, <i>murtis</i> of Sita were 
        commissioned. However His beauty was so extraordinary that the <i>murtis</i> 
        of Sita were becoming imbued with <i>madhura-rasa</i> sentiments. Sita's 
        <i>murtis</i> were melting in His presence, and He even had to tell them, 
        &quot;When I appear as Krishna, at that time all will be adjusted and 
        this kind of full heart's flow will be given vent then.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        that service is limited to one in Ayodhya, then when we go to Dwaraka, 
        Krishna has sixteen principle <i>saktis,</i> and a thousand extended variations 
        on their beauty, personality, charm and sweetness personified individually. 
        Not mere reflections, not that type of extension. So 16,108 queens. This 
        is expanding from that point. Then once it appears to be becoming more 
        and more exclusive it becomes deceptively simple. That is the Mathura, 
        Vrindavan, conception.</font></p>

          (Mahabharata, Bhisma parva 5.22)</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This 
        won't be grasped intellectually, mentally, or with a few books open before 
        you, collecting something from this one and adding it to what you took 
        from that one. Your equation from this will not produce the Infinite. 
        One comic strip writer, Gary Larsen, showed Einstein with a blackboard 
        on which were many letters and symbols from physics, and at the end it 
        showed 'equals' and then: the dollar sign. &quot;Einstein discovers that 
        time equals money!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It 
        is not like that. That you will extract from here and there and get an 
        infinite product as a result. Krishna is repulsed by that sort of approach. 
        Even Brahma and his four heads could not accommodate <i>aprakrita-lila.</i> 
        It is so deceptively simple. In <i>Sri Chaitanya-charitamrita </i>Kaviraj 
        Goswami says that Vrindavan has some measurement of sixteen <i>krosas 
        </i>(thirty-two square miles). That world which is all-accommodating and 
        most extensive, he is presenting in terms of some narrow confine, but 
        it is not to be taken literally. That plane, <i>chintamanis charana-bhusanam 
        angananam,</i> the jewels that spring out of that soil, <i>chintamani,</i> 
        that are desire and wish fulfilling touchstones, are being worn by the 
        Gopis as ornaments around the ankles of their lotus feet. So Krishna sent 
        Uddhava from Dwaraka to give him exposure to higher voltage devotion.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> People 
        talk about chanting <i>japa</i> and chanting Krishna<i>-nama, </i>so once 
        Srila Guru Maharaj said, &quot;Try to conceive what sort of voltage is 
        there when Srimati Radharani takes Krishna-<i>nama.&quot;</i> If we can 
        have even a remote glimpse of that, by His grace, then our only conclusion 
        would be to approach Her nearest agents and offer ourselves in service, 
        saying, &quot;I want to have a connection with that, so I am approaching 
        you because you are the nearest local agent who is representing that plane. 
        What can I do? I want to offer myself in service.&quot; <i>Diksa-kale 
        bhakta kare atma-samarpana (C.c. Antya 4:192.)</i> Otherwise <i>diksa</i> 
        is a formulaic ritual. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What 
        does it mean to offer oneself? Today is Ekadasi. Srila Gurudev says we 
        are offering some of ourselves, some energy to Krishna to consume, and 
        that is why we will feel something. If we are observing any of these things 
        properly we will feel some giving of the self, something will be there. 
        When Srila Saraswati Thakur spoke on this once, remembering that anything 
        can be discussed from many different points of view, he said, &quot;The 
        moon is in a particular position, increasing the flow of <i>rasa</i> so 
        the pleasure tendency is heightened. By fasting the senses are restored.&quot; 
        'Quellmed' a friend of mine once called it, a made up word from a combination 
        of 'quelled' and 'calmed.' Shakespeare made up a lot of words too.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        that is the effect, externally, but at the same time, mystically, Krishna's 
        desire is greater at this time for <i>rasa.</i> Whatever is in this world 
        is a perverted reflection of the original, so even on this very subject 
        also. What is pleasing to Krishna is <i>seva,</i> so the devotees at that 
        time try to increase their <i>seva. </i>And in terms of what level to 
        observe fasting, Srila Guru Maharaj's advice was, &quot;To the degree 
        that it does not incapacitate or debilitate you for service.&quot; What 
        is the utility of fasting to the point of debilitation? That is not our 
        line. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Just 
        to tie this to what we were talking about earlier, you can see also the 
        possibility of promotion within the plane of dedication from one position 
        to another, by inner necessity of the heart. Substantially. So those Dandakaranya 
        Rishis, as when Mahaprabhu was jesting with Venkata Bhatta about Laksmi 
        Devi, &quot;Why does your Laksmi Thakurani want to have <i>rasa</i> with 
        my Krishna?!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> At 
        first the reaction might be, &quot;What are you saying? Are you hinting 
        at impropriety? Please explain.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        Mahaprabhu continues, &quot;Well, Krishna is Rasaraj. When She wants those 
        types of Pastimes She is also going to Krishna. It is appropriate. Krishna 
        and Visnu siddhantically speaking are the same, but Krishna is highlighting 
        this particular aspect, so She is making Her approach there. However, 
        She is not given entrance into that plane.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So 
        right there we can stop and think, &quot;What are the qualifications to 
        enter? If Laksmi Devi herself cannot enter, then what are the qualifications 
        of the souls who can enter that plane?&quot; Still, Mahaprabhu says that 
        those Dandakaranya Rishis, and, according to <i>Garga-samhita,</i> ladies 
        from Mithila and other places were given entrance. <i>Vastu. Gopi bhava. 
        Gopi deho. </i>What is required is the right mood and the corresponding 
        form that personifies that mood and is qualified to move in that plane 
        of devotion</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What 
        time is it? Just see the detachment of our devotees: not one of them has 
        a watch!</font></p>
