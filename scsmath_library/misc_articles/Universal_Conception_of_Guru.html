              the offering of such an homage as has been arranged this evening 
              to the Acharyadev is not a sectarian concern, for when we speak 
              of the fundamental principle of Gurudev or Acharyadev, we speak 
              of something that is of universal application. There does not arise 
              any question of discriminating my Guru from yours or anyone else's. 
              There is only one Guru, who appears in an infinity of forms to teach

              it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental 
              knowledge, one must approach the Guru. Therefore, if the Absolute 
              Truth is one -- about which we think there is no difference of opinion 
              -- the Guru cannot be two. The Acharyadev to whom we have assembled 
              tonight to offer our humble homage is not the Guru of a sectarian 
              institution or one out of many differing exponents of the truth. 
              On the contrary, he is the <font color="#666666">jagad-guru</font>, 
              or the Guru of all of us; the only difference is that some obey 
              him wholeheartedly, while others do not obey him directly. In the

            the Blessed Lord. "Nobody should be jealous of the Spiritual Master 
            or think of him as an ordinary man, because the Spiritual Master is 
            the sum total of all demigods." That is, the Acharya has been identified 
            with God Himself. He has nothing to do with the affairs of this mundane 
            world. He appears before us to reveal the light of the Vedas and to 
            bestow upon us the blessing of full-fledged freedom, after which we

              transcendental knowledge of the Vedas was first uttered by God to 
              Brahma, the creator of this particular universe. From Brahma the 
              knowledge descended to Narada, from Narada to Vyasadeva, from Vyasadeva 
              to Madhva, and in this process of disciplic succession the transcendental 
              knowledge was transmitted by one disciple to another until it reached 
              Lord Gauranga, <a href="chaitanya_mahaprabhu.html">Sri Krishna Chaitanya</a>,

              present Acharyadev is the tenth disciplic representative from Sri 
              Rupa Goswami, the original representative of Lord Chaitanya who 
              preached this transcendental tradition in its fullness. The knowledge

              holy lips is the congenial thing for suffering humanity. All of 
              us should hear him patiently. If we listen to the transcendental 
              sound without unnecessary opposition, he will surely have mercy

              transcendental source of knowledge what we are, what is this universe, 
              what is God, and what is our relationship with Him. The message 
              of Lord Chaitanya is the message for the living entities and the 
              message of the living world. Lord Chaitanya did not bother himself 
              for the upliftment of this dead world, which is suitably named Martyaloka, 
              the world where everything is destined to die. He appeared before 
              us four hundred and fifty years ago to tell us something of the 
              transcendental universe, where everything is permanent and everything 
              is for the service of the Absolute. But recently Lord Chaitanya 
              has been misrepresented by some unscrupulous persons, and the highest 
              philosophy of the Lord has been misinterpreted to be the cult of 
              the lowest type of society. We are glad to announce tonight that 
              our Acharyadev, with his usual kindness, saved us from this horrible 
              type of degradation, and therefore we bow down at his lotus feet

              the invincible darkness of empirical knowledge. We are now so much 
              on the safe side that no amount of philosophical argument by the 
              empiric schools of thought can deviate us an inch from the position 
              of our eternal dependence on the lotus feet of His Divine Grace.
