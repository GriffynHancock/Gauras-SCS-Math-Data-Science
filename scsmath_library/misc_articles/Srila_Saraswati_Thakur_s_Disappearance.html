          transcript of a taped conversation (30 December 2004, Soquel, USA) by 
          Sripad Bhakti Sudhir Goswami Maharaj, was started after what may have 
          been a discussion about the Srila Jiva Goswami incident with Digvijaya 
          Pandit. Jiva Goswami was shown a paper signed by Rupa and Sanatan Goswamis, 
          who are <i>nirupadhi</i> <i>Vaisnavas,</i> acknowledging the pandit's 
          victory over them. An <i>uttama adhikari</i> <i>Vaisnava</i> sees everyone 
          as a devotee, so they may not criticise, yet at the same time there 
          are differences in the mood of various devotees. Srila Jiva Goswami, 
          who is also a <i>nirupadhi Vaisnava,</i> is serving in the mood of defender 
          and protector of Mahaprabhu's teachings, and he is also protecting the 
          honour of his Gurus, Srila Rupa and Sanatan Goswamis.] &#151; added

      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
        Seeing the signatures of Sri Rupa and Sri Sanatan Goswamis, apparently 
        acknowledging defeat, Sri Jiva Goswami was incensed, "This cannot be!" 
        and then soundly defeated the pundit. But <i>sahajiyas,</i> say, "Oh, 
        Jiva Goswami, doesn't have the same kind of humility that other Vaisnavas 
        possess," and they mean that in a disparaging way. But we take it that 
        he is showing another position of humility. Like that of Sri Vrindavan 
        Das Thakur, who implores the readers of <i>Sri Chaitanya Bhagavat</i> 
        to accept the mercy of Sri-Sri Gaura-Nitai, and specifically Nityananda 
        Prabhu, who is everything to Vrindavan Das Thakur. After so much entreaty, 
        so much pleading, because he knows the wealth they will get at the feet 
        of Gaura Nityananda, he says: "If you don't accept them, then I want to 
        kick on your face with my left foot" &#151; which is particularly insulting. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Srila 
        Guru Maharaj, Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj, said the 
        <i>sahajiyas</i> say, "Oh, Vrindavan Das doesn't have the kind of humility 
        that Krishna Das Kaviraj does." But he has another type of humility. Srila 
        Guru Maharaj recalled that Srila Saraswati Thakur revealed, "For those 
        who are hopeless, because if they won't take the mercy of the lotus feet 
        of Nityananda Prabhu, then they are considered a hopeless case, still 
        Vrindavan Das Thakur does not want them to escape, so by kicking them 
        in the face with his left foot, he has opened another channel for the 
        Lord's mercy!"</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sometimes 
        we see here at the temple, there are little children, and the parents 
        always want them to do something nice, so they say, "Oh, go over and give 
        <i>dandavats</i> to Maharaj." But then the children may say something 
        horrible or they do something embarrassing. Then the parents have to placate, 
        "We&#146;re sorry, he didn't mean it." Similarly if Vrindavan Das Thakur 
        kicks on their face, then Gaura-Nitai have to come and offer Themselves 
        as compensation. So Srila Saraswati Thakur said in this way Vrindavan 
        Das has opened another channel for Their mercy. We will not escape!</font> 
      </p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Srila 
        Saraswati Thakur had a Western disciple who was imprisoned in a concentration 
        camp in India during World War II. He was preaching to the inmates with 
        great intensity. He would tell them about Srila Saraswati Thakur and say, 
        "My Guru Maharaj's method is known as 'aggressive mercy.'" So, as Pusta 
        Krishna Prabhu mentioned recently, Srila Prabhupada was in that mood &#151; 
        blasting. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Srila 
        Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami Maharaj concurs: "Blasting!" On his 
        recent tour of Venezuela, we drove through four mountain tunnels on the 
        way to the temple in Caracas. Srila Govinda Maharaj reminisced, "Srila 
        Swami Maharaj blasted a tunnel through the Western ego and now we all 
        go through easily in grand style." And it's true. We sit here in the wake 
        of Srila Prabhupada's mercy. He assaulted modern civilisation head on, 
        face on. We didn't have a word for it then, but now it's, "politically 
        incorrect." He wasn't embarrassed to say that which is politically incorrect. 
        In fact, Srila Prabhupada was a master of using political incorrectness 
        to draw people's attention to the Krishna conception. He was not oblivious, 
        he knew what he was saying. He knew these were hot buttons &#151; he was 
        pressing their buttons, and that would get media coverage or would draw 
        people's attention toward his message.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So 
        Srila Saraswati Thakur also, issued a challenge that he will demonstrate 
        the superiority of the Krishna conception above all others &#151; and 
        he did. Srila Guru Maharaj has written of a parallel. As the sun of Mahaprabhu 
        arose, appeared, in Nabadwip and set in Puri so Srila Saraswati Thakur 
        appeared in Puri and withdrew in Nabadwip. There are some mystical references 
        in <i>Chaitanya Mangala</i> and elsewhere, with regard to an ancient Vedic 
        aphorism that says, "He will appear in the East." So from Puri, Jagannath 
        Puri <i>(Jagannath prasad)</i> the followers of Srila Saraswati Thakur 
        see that this divine mercy came out of Puri with the appearance of Srila 
        Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Not 
        only did Saraswati Thakur appear in Puri but from the front gate of the 
        Temple you can see his birth house. Not miles away &#151; which would 
        still qualify as being "Puri" &#151; but you couldn't get any closer. 
        He appeared there. And we're told at the time of the Rathayatra, by the 
        divine will of Jagannath, the chariot stopped and his mother presented 
        him before the Deity. A garland fell from Jagannath as an acknowledgement 
        that a <i>siddha mahapurus</i>, one of His own, has appeared.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Srila 
        Govinda Maharaj has said that when Srila Saraswati Thakur was born, just 
        as when Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur discovered the birthplace of Mahaprabhu, 
        he invited Jagannath Das Babaji for verification. He had prayed to Mahaprabhu 
        to send one of His own men. When Srila Saraswati Thakur appeared, Bhaktivinoda 
        Thakur held a festival and he invited Jagannath Das Babaji to come and 
        verify &#151; Vaisnava recognition &#151; that this is in fact a <i>siddha 
        mahapurus.</i> Jagannath Das Babaji came, they had a three day festival, 
        he observed the child, his movements, his physiognomy, and verified: yes, 
        for whom we were praying, he has appeared!</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Srila 
        Bhaktivinoda Thakur's gifts are unparalleled: through whom all our Scriptures 
        were revealed, the divine abode of Nabadwip Dham, Mahaprabhu's birthplace, 
        the songs of the Gaudiya canon, the <i>aratis,</i> the aspiration for 
        the service of the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani in the line of Sri 
        Rupa; everything we do is Bhaktivinoda-based. But as if that were not 
        enough he also gave us Guru, in the form of Srila Saraswati Thakur.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We 
        are told by Srila Guru Maharaj, that sometimes Bhaktivinoda Thakur worried 
        about the young Bimala Prasad (Saraswati Thakur). Bhaktivinoda Thakur 
        used to worry about him because he thought, "This boy, while at school, 
        he is always getting into fights, arguments with others." Over what? The 
        superiority of the Krishna conception and Mahaprabhu above all others. 
        And Guru Maharaj said, once Bhaktivinoda Thakur was talking with his son 
        &#151; one of those parental kind of "what are we going to do with you" 
        type talks; he said, "I'm worried about your future." And Saraswati Thakur 
        responded, "Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine." These things are 
        part of their play, the divine play of Bhaktivinoda Thakur and Saraswati 
        Thakur.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many 
        came to Bhaktivinoda Thakur for advice: <i>sahajiyas</i>, <i>jata gosai,</i> 
        this one, that one. Bhaktivinoda Thakur was aloof. When some so-called 
        <i>siddha mahatmya</i> came to Bhaktivinoda Thakur for consultation &#151; 
        which shows you who is Bhaktivinoda Thakur, <i>siddha mahatmyas</i> come 
        and ask him if they're doing OK &#151; when that <i>babaji</i> was there 
        talking with Bhaktivinoda, he noticed that a hundred feet away Saraswati 
        Thakur was giving <i>dandavats</i> to Bhaktivinoda Thakur. The man was 
        a little perplexed, "Why does the boy give <i>dandavats</i> from so far?" 
        Bhaktivinoda Thakur replied, "Oh him? Don&#146;t mind him. He has a vow 
        that he will not come within 100 feet of a <i>sahajiya</i> and he saw 
        you!"</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Bhaktivinoda 
        was everything to Saraswati Thakur, such that, Guru Maharaj said, he is 
        always using the word <i>"vinoda"</i> as an appellation for Deity names 
        like Radha Vinoda, etc. Saraswati Thakur could not tolerate that anyone 
        would have that name also. Bhaktivinoda could only mean one person. So 
        Srila Govinda Maharaj said that from this one event, we learn so many 
        things, one of which is that, when it came time for his Bimala Prasad, 
        which is the beginning name of Saraswati Thakur, to take initiation, Bhaktivinoda 
        Thakur didn't send him even to his own so-called <i>diksa guru,</i> but 
        rather to the lotus feet of Srila Gaura Kisor Das Babaji Maharaj. Sometimes 
        some questions come about Bhaktivinoda Thakur's <i>diksa guru</i> &#151; 
        this, that and the other thing. But to whom did he send Saraswati Thakur 
        to for connection? Not to the <i>jata gosai</i> birth line, specifically 
        not to give credence to that misconception. And as if to underscore this 
        point he even declined to give initiation himself.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So 
        the young Saraswati Thakur was sent to an actual <i>siddha mahatmya,</i> 
        Gaura Kisor Das Babaji Maharaj for <i>diksa</i>. Saraswati Thakur once 
        said, "My Guru Maharaj could not even write his name, but I found all 
        spiritual knowledge within a toenail of his holy lotus feet!" That Gaura 
        Kisor Das Babaji Maharaj was not easily approachable, so when Saraswati 
        Thakur, who had the reputation of being a <i>maha upadesaka pandit</i> 
        &#151; so scholarly, so learned &#151; sought his connection, Babaji Maharaj 
        said, "You are approaching me? Is this some kind of a joke? A man like 
        you, a renowned scholar, will approach me? This is ludicrous." He denied 
        him. But Saraswati Thakur persisted. Giving some recognition Gaura Kisor 
        Das Babaji Maharaj said, "I'll have to ask Mahaprabhu's permission." Saraswati 
        Thakur came again, and Babaji Maharaj said, "Oh, I forgot to ask Mahaprabhu!" 
        Saraswati Thakur became despondent.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When 
        he found Gaura Kisor Das Babaji Maharaj, we're told, Babaji Maharaj was 
        singing a song about Srila Raghunatha Das Goswami. We hear them sing it 
        in the evenings at the Radha Damodar Temple, <i>"Asta sakhi siromani Radhe 
        Radhe." </i><i>
        <! rÂdhe a£Èa sakh^ra þiromaÚi rÂdhe,
rÂdhe v˜£abhÂnu nandini rÂdhe rÂdhe (found in Devananda Gaudiya Math's song book)>
        </i>It has this <i>"Radhe Radhe" </i>in it. <i>"Mukhe Radha Radha bale, 
        &#151; bhese nayanera jale Radhe Radhe." </i>Raghunatha Das Goswami is 
        crawling on the divine soil of Radha Kunda, Govardhan, crawling on his 
        hands and knees on that sacred soil, with tears streaming down his eyes, 
        choked up, taking the name, "Radhe Radhe." That is why this is so sacred 
        to those in this line. Not that anyone and everyone shall casually vibrate 
        Her Divine Name for anything and everything. But Gaura Kisor Das Babaji 
        Maharaj was singing this song when Saraswati Thakur encountered him. Finally, 
        Babaji Maharaj consented to give his connection.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And 
        sometimes Gaura Kisor Das Babaji Maharaj, when he heard Saraswati Thakur 
        had some plans for preaching in Calcutta, he would say "Don't go there, 
        that's Kali's city (Kali's <i>sthan).</i> That city is full of <i>maya</i>. 
        Better to stay in the safety of the <i>Dham."</i> Saraswati Thakur replied, 
        " I have got so much charm in your foot-dust, I can conquer thousands 
        and thousands of Kalis! My purpose is to establish the <i>Dham</i>, or 
        Mahaprabhu's conception in the heart of <i>maya.</i> So in the most contaminated, 
        filthy place, that's where I want to make a throne for Mahaprabhu's Krishna 
        conception." And we have heard from Srila Govinda Maharaj that Srila Saraswati 
        Thakur never opened the window of his room in the Bagh Bazaar Gaudiya 
        Math. The shutters were never opened, because on the other side was a 
        brothel. He established his Math in the heart of <i>maya; </i>that divine 
        conception was broadcast from there.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There 
        are many who helped Srila Saraswati Thakur establish his mission. One 
        of his most stalwart servitors and assistants, whom he referred to as 
        the "co-founder" was Kunjabehari Vidyabhushan, "Kunja Babu," who later 
        became Srila Bhakti Vilas Tirtha Maharaj. He was in Calcutta with one 
        of his friends thinking there were no real <i>siddha mahatmyas</i> left 
        in the world because there were so many bogus impersonators, cheaters 
        and imitators. Somehow one of his friends said, "No, there is one left. 
        It's Gaura Kisor Das Babaji Maharaj and he lives in Nabadwip Dham." So 
        they went to see him but arrived on the day of Babaji Maharaj's disappearance. 
        At that very time, when there was some controversy about who would take 
        possession of his divine form, the two of them were dispatched to Mayapur 
        to inform his only known disciple, Srila Saraswati Thakur, who had already 
        got news and was coming on the way. When they crossed paths, at that time 
        he saw in his soon-to-be disciple, his Guru Maharaj coming to him. We 
        have heard, from Srila Swami Maharaj Prabhupada, a <i>maha-bhagavata guru 
        </i>doesn't accept anyone as a disciple, but rather he sees all 'disciples' 
        as <i>vaibhavas </i>or extensions of his Guru who has come to assist him 
        in that <i>seva</i> which he considers himself unfit and unqualified to 
        perform. So Srila Saraswati Thakur saw in this disciple of his, his own 
        Guru, Gaura Kisor Das Babaji Maharaj, and after &#151; I don't want to 
        go into the details of that, but after the <i>Samadhi</i> controversy 
        was settled, it was clear that Babaji Maharaj&#146;s divine form would 
        be taken by his only disciple, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur. 
        Sripad Tirtha Maharaj and the others presented themselves to Saraswati 
        Thakur to become his followers.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Srila 
        Guru Maharaj heard from his first two disciples that such was the intensity 
        of the Krishna conception within him and his attempt to extend it to others, 
        that he would pound the table with his fist while his veins would bulge 
        making his face flush red. Later witnessing the same, Srila Guru Maharaj 
        said we came to understand the meaning of 'lotus face.' His face, when 
        it was flushed with such intensity looked like a pink lotus flower in 
        full bloom!</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His 
        early followers lamented knowing that he was trying to "forcibly make 
        us taste some nectarean </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">substance, 
        but it was beyond our capacity." So Saraswati Thakur endowed them with 
        capacity. He gave them the capacity to appreciate this divine substance. 
        This is the way Krishna consciousness works. Those who are fortunate to 
        be in connection with Vaisnavas shall never think that this is our possession; 
        that we know something about Krishna consciousness. Rather, it is an endowment 
        from the upper world descending into this plane through the agency of 
        Guru-Vaisnava. And in their relativity, associating with them and serving 
        them, by their causeless mercy they may extend some consciousness of Krishna 
        to us. It is a divine gift. Srila Guru Maharaj once said, "It is a gift, 
        with the tacit understanding that, although it's being given freely, you 
        shall extend it to others." Adding, "and not anything less than was given 
        to you."</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So 
        Srila Saraswati Thakur was brought down from the spiritual world to this 
        plane because of his attraction for the wealth in the melted heart of 
        Bhaktivinoda Thakur. And he wanted to distribute that to others. He began 
        with two men, one by one converting many to his Krishna conception. These 
        were not street people, but highly educated men; the intelligentsia; those 
        with high levels of <i>sukriti;</i> highly spiritually evolved. But he 
        enriched them with the intensity of his Krishna conception and always 
        with the underlying understanding of extending it to others. Once Srila 
        Guru Maharaj said Saraswati Thakur distilled from all the teachings of 
        Bhaktivinoda Thakur the essential principle of association &#151; of superior 
        association: <i>sadhu-sangah svato vare</i> &#151;

        in the same line and superior; by superior association Krishna consciousness 
        is extended to others. So he created an association under the name and 
        style of Sri Gaudiya Math.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One 
        lawyer, after speaking with him for a few minutes, said, "Are you trying 
        to convert me?" and Saraswati Thakur said, "Yes, if you could only give 
        your attention for five minutes. But it wouldn't be a question of conversion 
        because once you realise what your wealth is, the actual inner wealth 
        of your heart, there would be no question of conversion. Rather, automatic 
        acceptance. You can't give those five minutes because ego is in the way. 
        But if you would realise that it is your <i>own</i> wealth, there would 
        be no necessity for conversion."</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Having 
        the nature of a reclusive philosopher, Srila Saraswati Thakur was living 
        alone in seclusion. His vow was to chant a billion Names of Krishna. That 
        means, roughly speaking, around 200 rounds a day, and then at the end 
        of a month he'd chant some extra, and then at the end of ten years &#151; 
        it's around ten years of chanting, that type of vow. But he came out of 
        that position, and one by one brought people under the influence of his 
        Krishna conception. So he said, "I began this movement ten years ago. 
        I was alone, now I have 500 men who say what I say. And with equal intensity." 
        In this way, from the heart of Saraswati Thakur, extended to the hearts 
        of his followers and to others, the Krishna consciousness movement was 
        being extended with so much emphasis on preaching to the West. Why the 
        West? He said because India is caught, captured by the glamour of Western 
        civilisation, just as the present world is captured by the glamour of 
        American pop consumer culture. It was not arbitrarily but a strategy. 
        The whole world is following them. If we can bring <i>them</i> under Mahaprabhu's 
        flag, then the whole thing can be captured.</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Srila 
        Guru Maharaj pointed out, this was Napoleon's strategy: attack the strongest 
        point, then the rest will topple. This was so earnestly and regularly 
        implored by him to his followers that there was one man in Gaudiya Math, 
        whose job was ploughing fields with oxen, and some of the devotees saw 
        that in his spare time he was studying English. They asked, "Prabhu, why 
        are <i>you</i> studying English?" And he said, "Well, Prabhupada says 
        we're all going to have to go and preach in the Western world; maybe some 
        day I'll be ploughing the fields of America!"</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As 
        Gaudiya Math expanded all over India, Srila Saraswati Thakur, expressed 
        some lamentation that it had not been taken to America. One preacher was 
        sent to England but came back, "half converted" &#151; damaged. A receiving 
        party composed of Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Maharaj Prabhupada, Srila 
        Guru Maharaj and others met him at the docks in Bombay upon his return. 
        They were so eager about this Western preaching that Srila Swami Maharaj 
        started inquiring from him what had happened. The sannyasi confided, "They 
        asked questions that cannot be answered." Swami Maharaj was puzzled, "What 
        are these questions that cannot be answered?" And one by one Srila Guru 
        Maharaj answered all the questions that "cannot be answered." When he 
        answered the last, the returned preacher was stunned and Srila Swami Maharaj 
        exclaimed to the delight of the assembled devotees, "Today, Europe has 
        been defeated by Asia!"</font> </p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many 
        years went by but Srila Swami Maharaj never forgot the order of Srila 
        Saraswati Thakur. He revealed that while reading Srila Viswanath Chakravarti 
        Thakur's commentary on <i>vyavasayatmika buddhir, ekeha Kuru-nandana (Gita 
        2:41), </i>&#151; regarding the sort of resolute determination one has 
        to have to be successful in Krishna consciousness &#151; he had an epiphany: 
        there is no other purpose to existence than to serve the order of Guru. 
        That is the sole meaning of a disciple's life. Srila Guru Maharaj observed, 
        he wholly emptied himself of any other want than Saraswati Thakur's cherished 
        desire to bring Krishna consciousness to the West. And he did that &#151; 
        extensively. Such was the magnitude of his preaching that Srila Guru Maharaj 
        declared him a <i>Saktyavesa Avatara.</i></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, 
        I feel Srila Guru Maharaj paid him the greatest compliment in appreciation 
        of his service to Srila Saraswati Thakur. After the publication of <i>Sri 
        Krishna Chaitanya,</i> Srila Saraswati Thakur sent preachers to the West 
        &#151; they were the advance party &#151; he himself was planning to spend 
        the next ten years of his life preaching in England and America. But he 
        left this world prematurely. Srila Guru Maharaj said, "but through Srila 
        Swami Maharaj, he gave our Guru Maharaj those ten years." It was Srila 
        Saraswati Thakur's heart's desire to extend Mahaprabhu's Krishna conception 
        to the people of the Western world. We know that Srila Prabhupada spread 
        the Krishna conscious movement around the world in roughly a ten-year 
        period. Srila Guru Maharaj said, "Through him, our Guru Maharaj was given 
        those ten years." What greater compliment than that!</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
        will conclude here to give others the chance to speak. But as Srila Guru 
        Maharaj wrote in the last line of this <i>sloka</i>,<i> vilasatu hrdi 
        nityam Bhaktisiddhanta vani, </i>
        <! the last oline of the verse nikhila bhuvana maya...>
