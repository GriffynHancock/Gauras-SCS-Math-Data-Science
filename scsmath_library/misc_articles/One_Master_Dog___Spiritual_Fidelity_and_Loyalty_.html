        <span class="txt_body_ital">In response to a question concerning &quot;chastity 
        to Sri Guru.&quot;</span><br>
        <br>
        Srila Sridhar Maharaja says initiation means essentially placing oneself 
        under the guidance of a superior Vaishnava. Guru means guide. In all spiritual 
        matters, especially in identifying whose association is desirable and 
        whose is undesirable we shall take guidance from our guru. Our own judgment 
        is not reliable. It is in recognition of this fact that we have approached 
        the lotus feet of Sri Guru. We should not be misled by the glaring misconceptions 
        of novices but focus upon Srila Gurudeva and our <i>guru varga</i> for 
        proper understanding and it&#146;s application.<br>
        <br>
        Srila Sridhar Maharaja instructs us, &quot;Because I am not reliable a 
        guardian is necessary. We think to know what is good, what is bad &#151; 
        I must keep that in my own hand. I cannot give that standard to any other's 
        hand. Good or bad, that responsibility I must not give to anyone. But 
        such thing is also to be given up, we must depend fully on the higher 
        guardian's decision.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;It is important, we must consciously do this: transfer the standard 
        of judging right and wrong &#151; the standard of judgment &#151; to give 
        it to another. I won't be able to judge my own interest. My interest will 
        be judged by my guardian. To transfer the standard of judgment to any 
        other hand is a dangerous thing, so we must do it consciously.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        As is the case in analyzing any precious substance, an expert&#146;s assessment 
        is necessary to identify the real from the fake (and all of the gradations). 
        There is no more valuable substance than Krishna consciousness, so how 
        indispensable is the discerning eye of an expert? The genuine conception 
        of chastity (fidelity, loyalty) we seek is apparent in the teachings and 
        behaviour of the highest devotees; those entrusted by Mahaprabhu with 
        His line (<i>sampradaya</i>).<br>
        <br>
        Raghunatha das Goswami was living only on a cup of buttermilk per day 
        but rejected that as unacceptable when the container was from the place 
        of an opposition party to his guru (<i>sakhi sthali</i>). Is his behaviour 
        a mere fanatical boycott or is there a deeper spiritual principle to be 
        considered? Rupa Goswami (the leader of this line) has praised the chatak 
        bird for not seeking sustenance from any other source than the unpredictable, 
        sometimes devastating thundercloud (<i>viracaya dandam dina bandhu dayam 
        va</i>). Srila Govinda Maharaja echoes these sentiments when he declares, 
        &quot;I am a one master dog.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        We should not allow the inept social interactions of neophytes to cast 
        a shadow upon the illuminating examples of superior Vaishnavas. Unfortunately 
        there are unscrupulous, so-called devotees masquerading as &quot;bosom 
        friends&quot; of gurus living and departed and sometimes blanket prohibitions 
        are in order. Often we use terms like &quot;association&quot; and &quot;devotee&quot; 
        in an all-encompassing sense but it is really higher association that 
        we seek. Srila Sridhar Maharaja gives his opinion in <i>Sri Guru and His 
        Grace</i>:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;In a certain stage, we should beware of bad association, so in <i>Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu</i> 
        (1.2.91) Rupa Goswami has said, <i>sajatiyasaye snigdhe sadhau sangah 
        svato vare</i>: what sort of saintly persons shall we try to mix with 
        earnestly? Those who are in our line, who have the same high spiritual 
        aspirations as we do, and who hold a superior position. To associate with 
        such saintly persons will help us the most to progress towards the ultimate 
        goal.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Rupanuga means to aspire to these standards and apply them in our life.<br>
