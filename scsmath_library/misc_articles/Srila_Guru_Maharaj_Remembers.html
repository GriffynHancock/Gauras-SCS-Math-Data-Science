            attraction was always towards Mahaprabhu... I wandered here and there 
            searching for a sadhu from whom to take initiation, but I couldn't 
            select anyone to my taste or satisfaction. One day [in Calcutta] I 
            saw a red-colored placard in Chittaranjan Avenue, advertising a Gaudiya 
            Math <font color="#666666">mahotsava</font> [grand festival] for one 
            month. I thought, Gaudiya Math must be Mahaprabhu's followers, let 
            me go and see what is there... </font> 
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>W</b>hen 
              I got there I found only one gentleman manning the outside hall; 
              the rest had all gone on procession of <font color="#66666">nagar-sankirtan</font> 
              [congregational chanting in the town]. I had a little talk with 
              that gentleman. I had studied somewhat about Chaitanyadev and other 
              Scriptures, but I found that these people representing the Math 
              had a deeper and more sound knowledge than I had. The party returned 
              from Nagar-Sankirtan and I saw Guru Maharaj at the head of the procession 
              with his <font color="#66666">danda</font> [mendicant's staff]. 
              As soon as he reached the front of the Math some disciple came and 
              took the danda from him, and gradually he was received there. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>A</b>t 
              first sight I found Guru Maharaj's attitude was that of complete 
              indifference to the ordinary world. He did not care for anyone; 
              he was self-sufficient. I got that sort of first impression. So 
              I began visiting the Math. Gradually I came to realize that I wanted 
              to stay in such company. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>U</b>nfortunately, 
              I had been unable to find [such company] before, but now the thought 
              came to me: what's to stop me coming and staying here? I cast my 
              glance homeward; father gone, mother living, three younger brothers: 
              they won't be much affected. But my wife will be affected. I don't 
              know why, but a sudden thought came to my mind that if she dies, 
              I am free. That thought came. I was attracted by that association 
              [of the Gaudiya Math]. There were so many members of gentlemanly 
              and educated nature, and wholly given to the Service of Mahaprabhu. 
              That attracted me most. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>A</b>nd 
              it was that very day, I came to my quarter and found that my wife 
              was ill. I came home that night, and after three days she passed 
              away. My mother tried to have me married again, but she was unsuccessful. 
              And within six months she also disappeared in Haridwar at the time 
              of the Kumbha Mela. She died there. One of my brothers, Satyen, 
              was attending her with other pilgrims and sisters, etc. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I</b> 
              was free; I was visiting the Math. I was thinking that I must cast 
              my faith here, so I thought it necessary to know as much as possible 
              about the mission; and to know the mission means to know the leader 
              of the mission. So I tried to go upstairs to where Guru Maharaj 
              had his quarters. I would go in front of his room and sit there 
              to hear, because I was thinking I shall join here. Then one day, 
              it so occurred that a brahmachari stopped me when I was making an 
              attempt to go upstairs. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<b>W</b>here 
              are you going?" </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<b>I</b>'m 
              going to Guru Maharaj. I like to hear and associate very much." 
              </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<b>N</b>o, 
              never. You must stay here in the waiting room, and when you see 
              anyone you will inform him whom you want to meet. He will check, 
              and when he returns with the answer, you can go. Otherwise you must 
              stay here. Never cross this threshold." </font>

              little harsh. Then I thought, "What should be the considerate nature 
              of the sadhus? Why should there be any difference outwardly and 
              inwardly? So I need not come here again!" </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>B</b>ut 
              at that very moment the position of Sukadev appeared in my mind. 
              I had read in the <font color="#666666">Mahabharat</font> that Srila 
              Vyasadev sent Srila Sukadev Goswami to Rajarsi Janak to finish his 
              education or sadhana. Srila Sukadev went, and he was detained for 
              seven days at the outer gate. Then information went to Janak, who 
              sanctioned, "Allow him to pass the gate." At the next gate, he was 
              again detained. In this way, there were seven boundaries of the 
              capital, and at each of the seven gates he was detained for seven 
              days. So seven times seven means forty-nine days he was detained, 
              and only then could he meet Janak. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>T</b>his 
              thought came to my mind. And then the next concluding thought came: 
              "If there is anything bad here, and they take me and put me onto 
              a throne to worship me, I should not come here; and if there is 
              real good, and they beat with a broomstick, I must not leave!" That 
              conclusion came to my mind, and I kept visiting. </font>

            day, Guru Maharaj was strolling on the roof [of the Math] just after 
            having taken his afternoon meal; he generally did not eat anything 
            at night. I approached, and stood silently in a corner. One man was 
            attending him. Guru Maharaj asked: "Has he something to say?" </font> 
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>T</b>he 
              attending person came to me and asked, "Have you something to say?"

              "He says he has nothing to say." Then Guru Maharaj said, "He has 
              something to ask?" The attendant again came to me, and said, "Guru 
              Maharaj says, have you got anything to ask?" </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<b>N</b>o, 
              I have nothing to ask." He returned to Guru Maharaj. "He says he 
              has nothing to ask." Again Guru Maharaj inquired: "He has got some 
              purpose in mind for coming here?" The attendant returned to me. 
              I said, "Yes, without purpose no incident can happen. When I came 
              here, I had some purpose." He enquired, "What is your purpose?" 
              </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<b>T</b>o 
              gain the grace of you all." That was my answer. Nothing else but 
              that. </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>P</b>erhaps 
              that touched Guru Maharaj. He approached me and enquired who I was, 
              what I did, where I lived, and so on. And then he said: "Yes, you 
              are fortunate. You are born in the area of Gauda-Mandal." They had 
              a booklet with them and the attending person brought it to me and 
              said, "Guru Maharaj is offering this booklet to you." </font>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"<b>I</b> 
              already have it," I replied, but he said, "That does not matter; 
              with his good will he is giving this to you, so it is something 
              else. You take it." So I took it on my head and accepted it. That 
              was the first talk with Guru Maharaj.</font>
