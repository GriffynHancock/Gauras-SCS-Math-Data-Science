            intensity is expressed here in a simple way. It is a mad search -- 
            an urgent campaign. With great earnestness Krishna comes to deliver 
            His lost servants; Krishna comes to take us home. In <font color="#666666">Brhad 
            Bhagavatamrta</font>, it is written that once, as Krishna and the 
            cows were returning from the Vrindavan forest at the end of the day, 
            a boy had just attained spiritual emancipation and entered Vrindavan 
            as a cowherd boy [<font color="#666666">sakhya rasa</font>]. Seeing 
            His long lost servant, Krishna embraced him and both of them fainted 
            in ecstasy. </font> 
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>A</b>ll 
              of Krishna's other cowherd friends were astounded, thinking, "What 
              is this? Krishna has lost His senses by embracing this newcomer! 
              How is it possible?" Then, as all of the cowherd boys looked on 
              astonished, Balaram came to Krishna's relief and somehow managed 
              to rouse Him. </font> 
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>T</b>hen 
              Krishna addressed His friend with great affection: "Why did you 
              stay away? Why have you been living away from home for so long? 
              How was it possible for you? How could you bear My separation? You 
              left Me, and you have been passing lives after lives without Me? 
              Still, I know what trouble you took to return to Me. You searched 
              for Me everywhere, and went to beg from house to house, and you 
              were chastised by many, ridiculed by many, and you shed tears for 
              Me. I know all these things. I was with you. And now, after great 
              trouble, you have again come back to Me." Krishna addressed His 
              long lost servant and welcomed him thus. And when Krishna returned 
              home, He took the newcomer by His side to take Prasadam. In this 
              way, a new recruit is earnestly welcomed by Krishna Himself. </font> 
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>S</b>o 
              the Lord's search for His lost servants is a loving search; it is 
              not ordinary, but from the heart. And the Lord's heart is not an 
              ordinary heart. Who can estimate what type of search He is engaged 
              in? Although He is full in all respects, still He feels pangs of 
              separation for every one of us, however small we may be. In spite 
              of His supreme position, He has room for us in a corner of His loving 
              heart. This is the nature of the infinite. Such an absolute autocrat, 
              absolute good, is Krishna. An autocrat is not under law. It is not 
              that if Krishna gives Himself to one, another will be lacking. The 
              infinite is not like that; rather there is an infinite supply at 
              His command. So He is the Emporium of Rasa [<font color="#666666">akhila-rasamrta 
              murtih</font>]. And He is searching for His lost servants, to bring 
              them home. </font>

              where the Kali Yuga Avatar is mentioned, we find evidence of the 
              advent of <a href="chaitanya_mahaprabhu.html">Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.</a>

            pilgrimage and great saintly persons by His touch and by His Sankirtan.

            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>T</b>his 
              verse generally applies to Lord Ramacandra, who left His kingdom,

              designed by His father, chased after the <font color="#666666">maya-mrgam</font>, 
              the golden deer. Srila Visvanath Cakravarti Thakur, however, shows 
              how this verse also applies to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He says 
              that the word <font color="#666666">maya-mrgam</font> means that 
              Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu ran after the souls that are enveloped 
              by <font color="#666666">maya</font>, or misconception. The word 
              <font color="#666666">maya-mrgam</font>, when applied to Ramacandra, 
              means that He ran after Marici, who had taken the form of a golden 
              deer. When applied in the case of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the 
              words <font color="#666666">maya-mrgam anvadhavat</font> mean "He 
              chased after those souls who are in illusion in order to deliver

            is desired by the beloved," that is, the search for Krishna. In this 
            way, He identifies two qualities in the Chaitanya Avatar: He relieves

              Entity Themselves, are hunting after the fallen souls to deliver 
              them. This will be the backbone of our conception of the Lord's 
              loving search for His lost servants. And it is also said: </font>

            with the demoniac." These are the references from the scriptures describing

            as our starting point, we can see that He is always coming to this

            of Krishna; the jiva soul is a manifestation of divinity which is 
            one with Krishna and different from Him. The jiva souls are the marginal 
            potency of the Lord. Though in reality they are servants of Krishna, 
            from time immemorial, they have been engaged in misconception, as 
            exploiting agents." In order to deliver His lost servants, the Lord 
            comes now and then to take them up to His own home. In other religions 
            we find many messiahs coming to help us to retrace our path from worldly

            this way, Krishna appears again and again to reclaim His long lost 
            servants. And, as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Krishna is also tasting 
            His own sweetness. When He wants to distribute it to the devotees, 
            the cause is His ecstatic potency [<font color="#666666">hladini-sakti</font>]. 
            When Krishna combines with His potency as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, 
            He becomes the Acarya. So Krishna says, <font color="#666666">acaryam

            is His self-distribution, and thereby He is taking His lost servants 
            home. His recruitment is to distribute knowledge about Himself and 
            devotion for Himself, and then to take them home. </font>

              and distributing that taste to others. His distribution and recruitment 
              are one and the same. By distributing Himself He is drawing our 
              hearts to Him, taking us home. The self-distribution of the Absolute 
              is meant to draw us back home, back to Godhead, and in this way,
