Śrī Nagara Kīrtana 4

‘rādhā-kṛṣṇa’ bol bol bolo re sobāi
(ei) śikṣā diyā, sab nadīyā
phirche neche’ gaura-nitāi
(miche) māyār bośe, jāccho bhese’,
khāccho hābuḍubu, bhāi

(1) Chant, chant “Rādhā-Krishna!” Everyone chant! When Lord Chaitanya and Lord Nityānanda came dancing through Nadia, They gave these teachings: Chant, chant “Rādhā-Krishna!” Everyone chant! You are caught up in a whirlpool of senseless action and are sinking lower and lower. Chant, chant “Rādhā-Krishna!” Everyone chant!

(jlv) kṛṣṇa-dās, e biśvās,
korle to' ār duḥkho nāi
(kṛṣṇa) bolbe jabe, pulak ha'be
jhorbe āṅkhi, boli tāi

(2) If you just understand that the spirit soul is the eternal servant of Krsna, you will never have any more sorrows. Chant Hare Krsna and your eyes will fill with tears and your body will feel transcendental shivering. Chant, chant “Rādhā-Krishna!” Everyone chant!

(‘rādhā) kṛṣṇa’ bolo, saṅge chalo,
ei-mātra bhikhā chāi
(jāy) sakal' bipod bhaktivinod
bole, jakhon o-nām gāi

(3) Simply chant “Rādhā-Krishna!” and join with us. Those are the only alms we beg. Chant, chant “Rādhā-Krishna!” Everyone chant! “All dangers will be gone when that Name is chanted,” says Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur. Chant, chant “Rādhā-Krishna!” Everyone chant!
