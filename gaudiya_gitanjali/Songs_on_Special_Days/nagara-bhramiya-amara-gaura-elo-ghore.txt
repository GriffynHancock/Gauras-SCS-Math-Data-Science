After parikramā

nagara bhramiyā āmāra gaura elo ghore
gaura elo ghore āmāra nitāi elo ghore
dhūlā jhāri śacīmātā gaura kole kore
ānandete bhakta-goṇe hari hari bole

(1) “After parikramā of the town, Gaurāṅga returns to His house, and Nitāi also comes to the house. Dusting off His body, Śachī Mātā takes Gaurāṅga upon her lap. Out of great spiritual joy all the devotees are chanting ‘Hari Hari Bol!’”
