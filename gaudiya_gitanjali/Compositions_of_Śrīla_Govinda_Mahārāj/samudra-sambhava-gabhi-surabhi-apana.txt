Śrī Govinda Kuṇḍa Māhātmya

atha govardhane ramye surabhi gauḥ samudrajā
snāpayā māsa gopeśaṁ dugdha dhārābhi rātnanaḥ
surabhe dugdha dhārābhi govinda snānato nṛpa
jāto govinda kuṇḍohadrau mahāpāpaharaḥ paraḥ
kadā chittasmin dugdhasya svādutvaṁ prati padyate
tatra snātvā naraḥ sākṣād govinda padamāpnuyāt
govinda kuṇḍe viśade yaḥ snāti kṛṣṇa-mānasaḥ
prāpnoti kṛṣṇa-sārūpyaṁ maithilendra na saṁśayaḥ

samudra-sambhavā gābhī surabhī āpana
dugdhe abhiṣeka koilo vrajendra-nandana

(3) Surabhī, the divine cow who appeared from churning the milk ocean, lovingly bathed Vrajendra Nandan Krishna with her own milk.

sei dugdhe pūrṇa kuṇḍa ‘śrī govinda’ nāma
ramya giri govardhane śobhe abhirāma

(4) The pond filled with that milk, “Śrī Govinda Kuṇḍa,” graces beautiful Govardhan with exquisite beauty.

kuṇḍavāri mahāpāpahārī se chinmoya
snāne pāne bhavabhaya tritāpa nāśaya

(5) The transcendental water of this Kuṇḍa can banish even the greatest sins. The threefold miseries—ādhyātmic, ādhidaivic and ādhibhautic—and all fears of this material world are destroyed by bathing in or drinking this water.

bahu-bhāgye keho sei dugdhāsvāda pāya
chidānanda-deho labhi kṛṣṇa-loke jāya

(6) Sometimes, by great fortune, someone will get to taste the water of Govinda Kuṇḍa as that milk, attain a transcendental form, and go to Krishna-loka.

śrī kṛṣṇa-mānase jebā kore hethā snāna
gupta-govardhane rādhā-kṛṣṇa-sevā pāna

(7) Anyone who bathes in Śrī Govinda Kuṇḍa, desiring to serve Krishna, attains divine service of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Krishna in Gupta Govardhan (hidden Govardhan).
