Śrī Prasāda-sevāya Gīti

bhāi-re!
śorīra avidyā-jāl,    joḍendriya tāhe kāl,
jīve phele viṣaya-sāgore
tā’ra madhye jihvā ati,    lobhamoy sudurmati,
tā’ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre

(1) Oh brothers! This material body is a network of ignorance, and the senses are one’s deadly enemies, for they throw the soul into the ocean of material sense enjoyment. Among the senses, the tongue is the most voracious and verily wicked; it is very difficult to conquer the tongue in this world.

kṛṣṇa boḍo dayāmoy,    koribāre jihvā jay,
sva-prasād-anna dilo bhāi
sei annāmṛta pāo,    rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāo,
preme ḍāko chaitanya-nitāi

(2) Oh brothers! Lord Krishna is very merciful—just to control the tongue He has given us the remnants of His own food! Now please eat these nectarean grains while singing the glories of Their Lordships Śrī Śrī RādhāKrishna, and in love call out Chaitanya! Nitāi!

(preme bhore ḍākare)
(dayāl nitāi chaitanya bole, preme bhore ḍākare)
(nitāi gaura haribol)
