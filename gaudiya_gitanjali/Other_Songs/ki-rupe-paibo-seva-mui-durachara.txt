Ki-rūpe pāibo sevā

ki-rūpe pāibo sevā mui durāchāra
śrī-guru-vaiṣṇave rati na hoilo āmāra

(1) I have no devotional attachment for either the Vaiṣṇavas or my Spiritual Master. How is it possible for a rascal like me to attain devotional service?

aśeṣa māyāte mana magana hoilo
vaiṣṇavete leśa-mātra rati nā janmilo

(2) My mind is always drowning in illusion. I have not even the smallest fragment of devotion for the Vaiṣṇavas.

biṣoye bhuliya andha hoinu divā-niśi
gole phā̐sa dite phere māyā se piśāchī

(3) I have become blind by constantly meditating on the objects of the senses. The witch Māyādevī has placed a hangman’s noose around my neck.

māyāre koriyā jaya chāḍāna na jāya
sādhu-kṛpā vinā āro nahiko upāya

(4) Even if I can cure my blindness and defeat Māyā in the form of this hangman, I cannot become free from material illusion without the mercy of the saintly devotees.

adoṣa daraśi-prabhu patita-uddhāra
ei-bāro narottame karaho nistāra

(5) Oh master, Oh purifier of the sinful, Oh saviour of the fallen souls, you do not see the faults of others, please rescue this Narottam Dās.
