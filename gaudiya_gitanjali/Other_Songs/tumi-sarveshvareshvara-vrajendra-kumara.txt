Tumi sarveśvareśvara

tumi sarveśvareśvara, vrajendra-kumāra!
tomāra ichāya viśve sṛjana saṁhāra

(1) O youthful son of the King of Vraja, You are the Lord of all lords. According to Your will, creation and destruction take place in the universe.

tava ichā-mato brahmā korena sṛjana
tava ichā-mato viṣṇu korena pālana

(2) According to Your desire Lord Brahmā creates and according to Your desire Lord Viṣṇu maintains.

tava ichā-mate śiva korena saṁhāra
tava ichā-mate māyā sṛje kārāgāra

(3) According to Your will Lord Śiva destroys, according to Your will Māyā constructs the prison house of this world.

tava ichā-mate jīver janama-maraṇa
samṛddhi-nipāta duḥkha sukha-saṅghaṭana

(4) According to Your will the living beings take birth and die, and according to Your will they meet with prosperity and ruin, happiness and sorrow.

miche māyā-baddha jīva āśā-pāśe phire
tava ichā vinā kichu korite nā pāre

(5) The tiny soul bound up by Māyā vainly struggles in the fetters of worldly desire. Without Your sanction the soul is unable to do anything.

tumi to’ rakṣaka āro pālaka āmāra
tomāra charaṇa vinā āśā nāhi āra

(6) You are my only protector and maintainer. Except for Your lotus feet there is no other hope for me.

nija-bala-cheṣṭa-prati bharasā chāḍiyā
tomāra ichāya āchi nirbhara koriyā

(7) No longer confident of my own strength and endeavour, I have become solely dependent on Your will.

bhakativinoda ati dīna akiñchana
tomāra ichāya tā’ra jīvana maraṇa

(8) Bhakti Vinod is most poor, and his pride has been leveled. Now in accordance with Your will he lives and dies.
