Dainya O Prapatti

hari he dayāla mora jaya rādhā-nātha
bāro bāro ei-bāro loho nija sātha

(1) O Hari! O my merciful Lord! All glories to You, the Lord of Rādhā! Many times I have avoided You, but this time please take me as Your own.

bahu joni bhrami nātha! loinu śaraṇa
nija-guṇe kṛpā kara adhama tāraṇa

(2) O Lord, after wandering through many wombs, I have taken refuge in You. Be merciful and deliver this wretched soul by Your divine power.

jagata-kāraṇa tumi jagata-jīvana
tomā chāḍā kāro na’hi he rādhā-ramaṇa

(3) O lover of Rādhā, You are the cause of the universe and the life of the universe. Without You no-one has anything.

bhuvana-maṅgala tumi bhuvanera pati
tumi upekṣile nātha, ki hoibe gati

(4) You bring about auspiciousness for the world, and You are the master of all the worlds as well. O Lord, what will be my refuge if You neglect me?

bhāviyā dekhinu ei jagata-mājhāre
tomā vinā keho nāhi e dāse uddhāre

(5) I have considered that in this world there is no one except You who can deliver this fallen servant.
