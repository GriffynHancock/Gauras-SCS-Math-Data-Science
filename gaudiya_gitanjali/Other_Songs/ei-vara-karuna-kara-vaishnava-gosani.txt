Vaiṣṇava Vijñāpti

Vaiṣṇava Vijñāpti

ei-vāra karuṇā kara vaiṣṇava gosāñi
patita-pāvana tomā vine keha nāi

(1) O Vaiṣṇava Goswāmī, please be merciful to me this one time. You are the saviour of the fallen; without you there is no one.

kāhāra nikaṭe gele pāpa dūre yāya
emana dayāla prabhu kevā kothā pāya

(2) Just by being in your presence, sins go far away. Where can anyone find such kindness?

gaṅgāra paraśa haile paśchāte pāvana
darśane pavitra kara ei tomāra guṇa

(3) Merely by the touch of the waters of the sacred Ganges one becomes liberated, even if he is the lowest of mankind; but just by seeing you, the same effect is achieved. Such is your quality.

hari-sthāne aparādhe tāre harināma
tomā-sthāne aparādhe nāhika eḍāna

(4) If one commits an offence at the feet of Lord Hari, he can be forgiven if he chants the Holy Name. But if one offends you, there is no salvation for him.

tomāra hṛdaye sadā govinda-viśrāma
govinda kahena mama vaiṣṇava parāna

(5) In your heart Govinda is always resting. Śrī Govinda Himself says, “My devotees are My life and soul.”

prati janme kari āśā charaṇera dhuli
narottame kara dayā āpanāra vali

(6) I hope that in every birth I will obtain the dust of your lotus feet. Śrī Narottam prays, “Please, Oh Vaiṣṇava Goswāmī, be kind unto me.”
