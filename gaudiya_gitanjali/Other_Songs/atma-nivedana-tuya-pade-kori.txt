Ātma-nivedana

ātma-nivedana,    tuyā pade kori,
hoinu parama sukhī
duḥkha dūre gelo,    chintā nā rohilo,
chaudike ānanda dekhi

(1) I have become supremely joyful by surrendering myself at Your holy feet. Unhappiness has gone away, and there are no more anxieties. I see joy in all directions.

aśoka-abhaya,    amṛta-ādhāra,
tomāra charaṇa-dvaya
tāhāte ekhona,    viśrāma lobhiyā
chāḍinu bhavera bhaya

(2) Your two lotus feet are reservoirs of immortal nectar where one may live free from sorrow and fear. I have found peace there now and have given up the fear of worldly existence.

tomāra saṁsāre,    koribo sevana,
nahibo phalera bhāgī
tava sukha jāhe,    koribo jatana,
ho’ye pade anurāgī

(3) I shall render service in Your household and not endeavour to enjoy the fruits of that service, but rather I shall strive for whatever pleases You, fully devoted to Your lotus feet.

tomāra sevāya,    duḥkha hoya jato,
seo to’ parama sukha
sevā-sukha-duḥkha,    parama sampada
nāśoye avidyā-duḥkha

(4) Troubles encountered in Your service shall be the cause of great happiness, for in Your devotional service joy and sorrow are equally great riches. Both destroy the misery of ignorance.

pūrva itihāsa,    bhulinu sakala,
sevā-sukha pe’ye mane
āmi to’ tomāra,    tumi to’ āmāra,
ki kāja apara dhane

(5) I have completely forgotten all past history by feeling great joy in my mind. I am most certainly Yours, and You are indeed mine. What need is there of any other treasure?

bhakativinoda,    ānande ḍubiyā,
tomāra sevāra tore
saba cheṣṭā kore,    tava ichā-mata,
thākiyā tomāra ghore

(6) Bhakti Vinod, diving into the ocean of bliss, devotes all his efforts for Your service and dwells in Your house according to Your wishes.
