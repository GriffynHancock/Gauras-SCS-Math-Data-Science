Mānasa Deho Geho

mānasa, deho, geho, jo kichū mora
arpilu̐ tuyā pade, nanda-kiśora!

(1) Mind, body, and family, whatever may be mine, I have surrendered at Your lotus feet, O youthful son of Nanda!

sampade vipade, jīvane-maraṇe
dāy mama gelā, tuyā o-pada varaṇe

(2) In good fortune or in bad, in life or at death, all my difficulties have disappeared by choosing those feet of Yours as my only shelter.

mārobi rākhobi—jo ichā tohārā
nitya-dāsa prati tuyā adhikārā

(3) Slay me or protect me as You wish, for You are the master of Your eternal servant.

janmāobi moye ichā jadi tora
bhakta-gṛhe jani janma hau mora

(4) If it is Your will that I be born again, then may it be in the home of Your devotee.

kīṭa-janma hau yathā tuyā dāsa
bahir-mukha brahma-janme nāhi āśa

(5) May I be born again even as a worm, as long as I may remain Your devotee. I have no desire to be born as a Brahmā averse to You.

bhukti-mukti-spṛhā bihīna je bhakta
labhaite tā̐ka saṅga anurakta

(6) I yearn for the company of the devotee completely devoid of all desire for worldly enjoyment or liberation.

janaka, jananī, doyita, tanoy
prabhu, guru, pati—tuhu̐ sarva-moy

(7) Father, mother, lover, son, Lord, preceptor, and husband — You are everything to me.

bhakativinoda kohe, śuno kāna!
rādhā-nātha! tuhu̐ hāmāra parāṇa

(8) Bhakti Vinod says, “O Krishna, please hear me! Oh Lord of Rādhā, You are my life and soul!”
