Nivedana 2

Nivedana

gopīnāth,    ghuchāo saṁsāra-jvālā
avidyā-jātanā,    āro nāhi sahe,
janama-maraṇa-mālā

(1) Oh Gopīnāth, please remove the torment of worldly existence. I can no longer tolerate the pain of ignorance and the repeated succession of rebirth and death.

gopīnāth,    āmi to kāmera dāsa
viṣoya-vāsanā,    jāgiche hṛdoye,
phāṅdiche karama phāṅsa

(2) Oh Gopīnāth, indeed I am a servant of lust. Worldly desires are awakening in my heart, and thus the noose of fruitive work is beginning to tighten.

gopīnāth,    kobe vā jāgibo āmi
kāma-rūpa ari,    dūre teyāgibo,
hṛdoye sphuribe tumi

(3) Oh Gopīnāth, when will I wake up and abandon afar this enemy of lust, and when will You manifest Yourself in my heart?

gopīnāth,    āmi to’ tomāra jon
tomāre chāḍiyā,    saṁsāra bhajinu,
bhuliyā āpana-dhana

(4) Oh Gopīnāth, I am Your devotee, but having abandoned You and thus having forgotten my real treasure, I have worshiped this mundane world.

gopīnāth,    tumi to sakali jāno
āpanāra jane,    daṇḍiyā ekhona,
śrī-charaṇe deho sthāno

(5) Oh Gopīnāth, You know everything. Now, having punished Your servant, please give him a place at Your lotus feet.

gopīnāth,    ei ki vichāra tava
vimukha dekhiyā,    chāḍa nija-jane,
na kara karuṇā-laba

(6) Oh Gopīnāth, is this Your judgement, that seeing me averse to You, You abandon Your servant and don’t bestow even a particle of mercy upon him?

gopīnāth,    āmi to mūrakha ati
kise bhālo hoya,    kabhu nā bujhinu,
tāi heno mama gati

(7) Oh Gopīnāth, I am certainly very foolish, and I have never known what is good for me. Therefore such is my condition.

gopīnāth,    tumi to paṇḍita-vara
mūḍhera maṅgala,    sadā anveṣibe,
e dāse nā bhāva para

(8) Oh Gopīnāth, You are indeed the wisest person. Please look for a way to bring about auspiciousness for this fool, and please do not consider this servant as an outsider.
