Viraha-gīti

je ānilo prema-dhana karuṇā prachura
heno prabhu kothā gelā āchārya-ṭhākura

(1) That personality who delivered the treasure of prema-bhakti, who was so intense with compassion — where is such a personality to be found as Śrī Āchārya Ṭhākur (Śrīnivās Āchārya)?

kā̐hā mora svarūp rūpa kā̐hā sanātana
kā̐hā dāsa raghunātha patita-pāvana

(2) Where are the saviours of the fallen souls? Where is my Svarūp Dāmodar, and where are Rūpa Goswāmī and Sanātan Goswāmī? Where is Raghunāth Dās to be found?

kā̐hā mora bhaṭṭa-juga kā̐hā kavirāja
eka-kāle kothā gelā gaurā naṭa-rāja

(3) Where are my Raghunāth Bhaṭṭa and Gopāl Bhaṭṭa Goswāmīs? Where am I to find Śrī Krishnadās Kavirāj now? All at once they have gone to join Lord Gaurāṅga, the great dancer.

pāṣāṇe kuṭibo māthā anale paśibo
gaurāṅga guṇera nidhi kothā gele pābo

(4) To reach such a perfect personality as Lord Chaitanya, I can only break my head against the stone in the anguish of separation.

se-saba saṅgīra saṅge je koilo vilāsa
se-saṅga nā pāyā kānde narottama dāsa

(5) They have all gone off together in their own Pastimes. Narottam Dās Ṭhākur says: “Unable to obtain their association, I must simply weep.”
