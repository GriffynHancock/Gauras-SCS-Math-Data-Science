Iṣṭa-deve Vijñapti

hari hari!    biphole janama goyāinu
manuṣya-janama pāiyā,    rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,
jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu

(1) Oh Lord Hari, I have spent my life uselessly. Having obtained a human birth and having not worshipped Rādhā and Krishna, I have knowingly drunk poison.

golokera prema-dhana,    harināma-saṅkīrtana,
rati nā janmilo keno tāya
saṁsāra-biṣānale,    divā-niśi hiyā jvale,
juḍāite nā koinu upāya

(2) The treasure of divine love in Goloka Vṛndāvan has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari’s Holy Names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns from the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not taken the means to relieve it.

vrajendra-nandana jei,    śachī-suta hoilo sei,
balarāma hoilo nitāi
dīna-hīna jata chilo,    harināme udhārilo,
tāra śākṣī jagāi mādhāi

(3) Lord Krishna, who is the son of the King of Vraja, became the son of Śachī (Lord Chaitanya), and Balarām became Nitāi. The Holy Name delivered all those souls who were lowly and wretched. The two sinners Jagāi and Mādhāi are evidence of this.

hā hā prabhu nanda-suta,    vṛṣabhānu-sutā-juta,
karuṇā karaho ei-bāro
narottama-dāsa koy,    nā ṭheliho rāṅgā pāy,
tomā bine ke āche āmāra

(4) Oh Lord Krishna, son of Nanda, accompanied by the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, please be merciful to me now. Narottam Dās says, “O Lord, please do not push me away from Your reddish lotus feet, for who is my beloved except for You?”
