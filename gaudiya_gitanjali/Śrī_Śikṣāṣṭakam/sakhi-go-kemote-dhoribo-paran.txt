7c. Sakhī go kemote
-------------------

Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

sakhi go kemote dhoribo parāṇ
nimeṣa hoilo jugera samān

(1) Oh my dear girlfriend! How will I  maintain my life? The passing of a mere moment has become like a vast age of time.

śrāvaṇera dhārā,    ā̐khi-bariṣoy,
śūnya bhelo dharā-tala
govinda-virahe,    prāṇa nāhi rohe,
kemone bā̐chibo bolo

(2) Tears flow from my eyes like torrents of rain in the month of Śrāvaṇa, and the face of the earth has become totally void. In separation from Govinda my life cannot go on... please, tell how I will be able to live.

bhakativinoda,    asthira hoiyā,
punaḥ nāmāśroya kori’
ḍāke rādhānātha,    diyā daraśana,
prāṇa rākho, nahe mori

(3) Bhakti Vinod has become very restless and again takes shelter of the holy name, calling out, “Oh Lord of Rādhā! By bestowing Your audience, please save my life! By Your mercy alone I shall not perish!”
Footnote to verse 1: Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāja advised not to sing ‘sakhi go’ but ‘bandhu he’ instead.
