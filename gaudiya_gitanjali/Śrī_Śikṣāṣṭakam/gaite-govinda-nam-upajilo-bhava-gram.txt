7b. Gāite ‘govinda’–nām
-----------------------

Śrī Śikṣāṣṭakam

gāite ‘govinda’-nām,    upajilo bhāva-grām,
dekhilām yamunāra kūle
vṛṣabhānu-sutā-saṅge,    śyāma-naṭa-boro-raṅge,
bā̐śarī bājāya nīpo-mūle

(1) And while I sang the name of Govinda a host of ecstasies arose within me. I saw Sundar-śyāma the best of dancers, on Yamunā’s shores, with Śrī Rādhā, Vṛṣabhānu’s daughter, sporting in Pastimes of love playing His flute beside the water while a kadamba tree above cast shade upon the divine couple.

dekhiyā jugala-dhana,    asthira hoilo mana,
jñāna hārā hoilu̐ tokhon
koto-kṣane nāhi jāni,    jñāna-labha hoilo māni,
āro nāhi bhelo daraśan

(2) On seeing this, my mind was stunned. I lost my senses. Unaware of time, I fainted. When I awoke after immeasurable time, the treasured couple had gone. My vision of Vraja had broken.
