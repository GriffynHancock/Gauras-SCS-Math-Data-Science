Aruṇodoya-kīrtan

jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo, gaurāchā̐da bole
kota nidrā jāo māyā-piśāchīra kole

(1) Lord Gaurāṅga calls, “Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls! You have slept so long in the lap of the witch Māyā.”

bhajibo boliyā ese saṁsāra-bhitore
bhuliyā rohile tumi avidyāra bhore

(2) “You came into this world saying, ‘O my Lord, I will certainly worship You’, but having forgotten this promise, you have remained in great ignorance.”

tomāre loite āmi hoinu avatāra
āmi vinā bandhu āra ke āche tomāra

(3) “I have descended just to save you. Other than Myself, who else is your friend?”

enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi’
hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi māgi’

(4) “I have brought the medicine for destroying the illusion of māyā. Now pray for this Hari-nāma-mahāmantra and take it.”

bhakativinoda prabhura-charaṇe poḍiyā
sei hari-nāma-mantra loilo māgiyā

(5) Ṭhākur Bhakti Vinod fell at the lotus feet of Lord Gaurāṅga, and after begging for the Holy Name he received that mahāmantra.
