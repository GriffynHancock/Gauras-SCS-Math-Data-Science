Auspicious Invocation to Śaraṇāgati
-----------------------------------

Auspicious Invocation

śrī-kṛṣṇa-chaitanya prabhu jīve dayā kori’
svapārṣada svīya dhāma saha avatari

(1) Lord Śrī Krishna Chaitanya,
Being gracious upon the jīva-souls,
Along with Your associates and abode
You descended to this world

atyanta durlabha prema koribāre dāna
śikhāya saraṇāgati bhakatera prāṇa

(2) To distribute freely
the love divine most rare;
By teaching exclusive surrender,
the life and soul of the devotee

dainya, ātmanivedana, goptṛtve varaṇa
‘avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa’—viśvāsa pālana

(3) Humility, self-giving,
Embracing His guardianship,
‘Krishna will certainly protect me’ —
Maintaining this faith.

bhakti-anukūla mātra kārjera svīkāra
bhakti-pratikūla bhāva—varjanāṅgīkāra

(4) Acceptance of all activities
favourable to devotion;
Embracing rejection of
adversity to devotion.

ṣaḍ-aṅga śaraṇāgati hoibe jā̐hāra
tā̐hāra prārthanā śune śrī-nandakumāra

(5) Those who surrender in this sixfold way —
Their prayer will be heard
by the divine son of Nanda.

rūpa-sanātana-pade dante tṛṇa kori’
bhakativinoda poḍe dui pada dhori’

(6) Taking in his mouth a straw, falling
at the lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa-Sanātan;
Śrī Bhakti Vinod clasps their holy lotus feet.

kā̐diyā kā̐diyā bole, āmi to’ adhama
śikhāye śaraṇāgati karahe uttama

(7) Weeping, weeping, I implore thee,
‘O I am afallen!
Please teach me to surrender,
teach me pure devotion.’
