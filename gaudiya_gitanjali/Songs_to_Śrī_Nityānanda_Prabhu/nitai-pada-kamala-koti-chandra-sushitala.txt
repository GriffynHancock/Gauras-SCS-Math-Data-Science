Manaḥ-Śikṣā

nitāi-pada-kamala,    koṭī-chandra-suśītala,
je chāyāya jagata juḍāy
heno nitāi bine bhāi,    rādhā-kṛṣṇa pāite nāi,
dṛḍha kori dharo nitāira pāya

(1) The holy lotus feet of Nitāi,
cooling like ten million moons —
In the shade of which
the world gains soothing relief;
Without that Nitāi, O brother,
No one can reach Rādhā and Krishna —
Clasp His lotus feet with full conviction.

se sambandha nāhi jāra,    vṛthā janma gelo tāra,
sei paśu boḍo durāchāra
nitāi nā bolilo mukhe,    majilo saṁsāra-sukhe,
vidyā-kule ki koribe tāra

(2) One who never got His connection,
passed his life in vain —
Such an animal is so very wicked;
He whose mouth never uttered ‘Nitāi,’
merged in mundane pleasures —
How can his aristocratic lineage save him?

ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā,
asatyere satya kori māni
nitāiyer karuṇā habe, vraje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe,
dharo nitāiyer charaṇ du’ khāni

(3) Maddened with pride,
forgetting the lotus feet of Nitāi —
I embrace untruth as truth;
But when Nitāi gives His Grace
you’ll reach Rādhā and Krishna in Vraja —
O embrace the lotus feet of Nitāi!

nitāiyer charaṇa satya, tā̐hāra sevaka nitya,
nitāi-pada sadā kara āśa
narottama boḍo duḥkhī, nitāi more kara sukhī
rākho rāṅgā-charaṇera pāśa

(4) The lotus feet of Nitāi are truth,
His servitors are eternal —
Ever aspire for the shelter of His feet;
Narottam is very sad — O Nitāi make me happy —
Please keep me at Your lovely lotus feet!
