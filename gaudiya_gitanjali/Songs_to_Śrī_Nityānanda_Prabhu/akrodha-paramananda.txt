Akrodha paramānanda

Akrodha paramānanda

akrodha paramānanda nityānanda rāy
abhimāna-śūnya nitāi nagare beḍāy

(1) The great personality, Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, is free from anger and full of transcendental ecstasy. He wanders throughout the towns, free from false pride and arrogance.

adhama patita jīver dvāre dvāre giyā
harināma mahāmantra dena bilāiyā

(2) He travels from door to door to the homes of the fallen souls, freely distributing the Hare Krishna mahāmantra.

jāre dekhe tāre kohe dante tṛṇa kori
āmāre kiniyā loho bhaja gaurahari

(3) With straw between His teeth, He begs all who cross his path, “Worship Lord Gaurahari and you will purchase me.”

eta boli’ nityānanda bhūme goḍi jāy
sonāra parvata jena dhūlāte loṭāy

(4) Saying this Nityānanda falls to the ground, appearing like a golden mountain rolling in the dust.

heno avatāre jāra rati nā janmilo
lochan bole sei pāpī elo āra gelo

(5) Where attachment for such an incarnation has not arisen, Lochan Dās says that such a sinful person comes and goes in the cycle of repeated birth and death.
