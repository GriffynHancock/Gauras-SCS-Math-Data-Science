Nitāi guṇamaṇi āmāra

nitāi guṇamaṇi āmāra nitāi guṇamaṇi
āniyā premera vanyā bhāsāla abanī

(1) O my Lord Nityānanda, the jewel of all good qualities; O Nitāi, the jewel of all good qualities has brought a flood of ecstatic love of Godhead that has drowned the whole world.

premavanyā loye nitāi āila gāuḍa deśe
ḍubilo bhakata-gaṇa dīnahīna bhāse

(2) Lord Nityānanda has brought this overwhelming deluge of love of Godhead to the land of Bengal on Lord Chaitanya’s order. The devotees have been inundated by this deluge but the unfortunate non-devotees have remained floating on that ecstatic ocean.

dīnahīna patita pāmara nāhi bāche
brahmāra durlabha prema sabākāre jāce

(3) Lord Nityananda freely offered this rare gift of love of Godhead, which is difficult for even Lord Brahmā to attain, to the fallen and wretched souls who were not desirous of receiving it.

ābaddha karuṇā-sindhu kāṭiyā muhāna
ghore ghore bule prema-amiyāra bāna

(4) The ocean of mercy had formerly been tightly sealed, but Lord Nitāi cut a channel in its boundary to allow the great flooding waves of ecstatic love to wash down from house to house.

lochan bole heno nitāi jebā nā bhajilo
jāniyā śuniyā sei ātmaghātī hoilo

(5) Lochan Dās says, “Whoever has not worshipped this Lord Nitāi, or accepted the great gift offered by Him, that person knowingly commits suicide.”
