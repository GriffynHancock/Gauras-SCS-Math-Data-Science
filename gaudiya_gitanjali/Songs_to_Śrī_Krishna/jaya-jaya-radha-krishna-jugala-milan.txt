Śrī Jugala-ārati

jaya jaya rādhā-kṛṣṇa jugala-milan
ārati karaye lalitādi sakhī-goṇ

(1) All glories, all glories to the meeting of the transcendental couple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā Krishna. The gopīs headed by Lalitā devī perform the ceremony of their worship.

madana-mohana rūpa tri-bhaṅga-sundara
pītāmbara śikhi-pucha-chūḍā-manohara

(2) Krishna is the attractor of Cupid, and His beautiful form is bending in three places with yellow garments and a charming peacock-feather crown.

lalita-mādhava-bāme vṛṣabhānu-kanyā
nīla-basanā gaurī rūpe guṇe dhanyā

(3) Dressed in blue garments, Her complexion fair, and Her virtues glorious, King Vṛṣabhānu’s daughter, Śrīmatī Rādhikā is on the left of the charming Lord Mādhava.

nānā-bidha alaṅkāra kore jhalamala
hari-mano-bimohana vadana ujjvala

(4) Her various ornaments sparkle and Her effulgent face charms the heart of Lord Krishna.

viśākhādi sakhī-goṇ nānā rāge gāya
priya-narma-sakhī jata chāmāra ḍhulāya

(5) Viśākhā and the other girls sing songs in various tunes and moods as Krishna’s intimate playful girlfriends fan the divine couple with whisks.

śrī-rādhā-mādhava-pada-sarasija-āśe
bhakativinoda sakhī-pade sukhe bhāse

(6) Yearning to attain the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Krishna, Bhakti Vinod floats in happiness at the gopīs’ feet.
