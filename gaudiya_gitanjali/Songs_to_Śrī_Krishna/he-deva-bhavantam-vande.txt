He deva bhavantaṁ vande

He deva bhavantaṁ vande

he deva bhavantaṁ vande
man-mānasa-madhukara marpaya nija-pada-
paṅkaja-makarande

(1) Oh Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances to You. May you place the bumblebee of my mind in the honey of Your lotus feet.

yadapi samādhiṣu vidhir api paśyati
na tava nakhā gramarīchim
idam ichāmi niśamya tavāchyuta
tad api kṛpādbhuta vīchim

(2) Although Brahmā in his samādhi cannot obtain a glimpse of even a ray of the tips of the nails of Your feet, still Oh Achyuta! Having heard of the waves of Your astonishing mercy, I yearn to see You.

bhaktir udañchati yad api mādhava
na tvayi mama tila-mātrī
parameśvaratā tad api tavādhika-
durghaṭa-ghaṭana-vidhātrī

(3) Oh Mādhava, although I have not even a sesame seed of devotion for You, Your supreme power can make even the impossible become possible.

ayam avilola tayādya sanātana
kalitādbhuta-rasa-bhāram
nivasatu nityam ihāmṛta-nindini
vindan madhurima-sāram

(4) Oh eternal Lord, may the bumblebee of my mind, finding there the most wonderful sweetness, eternally stay in the honey of Your lotus feet, which rebuke the sweetest nectar.
