Prayers to the Vaiṣṇavas

sakala vaiṣṇava-pade mora namaskāra
ithe kichu aparādha nahuka āmāra
hoiyachen hoiben prabhur jato bhakta jan
vandanā kori’ āmi sabāra charaṇa

(1) “I respectfully bow to the lotus feet of all the Vaiṣṇavas, praying that there is no offence in my attempt to please them. To all Vaiṣṇavas who have been, and all Vaiṣṇavas who shall be, I offer my obeisances to their lotus feet.”
