Śrī Tulasī-parikramā-gīti

namo namaḥ tulasī mahārāṇī,
vṛnde mahārāṇī namo namaḥ

(1) O Tulasī Mahārāṇī, O Vṛnda Devī, I offer my obeisances unto you again and again.

namo re namo re māiyā namo nārāyaṇi

(2) O Nārāyaṇi I offer you my obeisances again and again.

jāko daraśe, paraśe agha-nāśa-hoi
mahimā veda-purāṇe bākhāni

(3) By seeing or touching you all sins are destroyed. Your glories are sung in the Vedas and Purāṇas.

jāko patra, mañjarī komala
śrī-pati-charaṇa-kamale lapaṭāni
dhanya tulasi, pūraṇa tapa kiye,
śrī-śālagrāma-mahā-pāṭarāṇī

(4) Your leaves and soft mañjarīs are entwined at the lotus feet of Lord Nārāyaṇa. O Tulasī by your performance of austerity you have become the worshipful consort of Śrī Śālagrām Śila.

dhūpa, dīpa, naivedya, āroti,
phulanā kiye varakhā varakhāni
chāppānna bhoga, chatriśa vyañjana,
vinā tulasī prabhu eka nāhi māni

(5) You shower your mercy upon anyone who offers you incense, lamp, foodstuffs, worship and flowers. The Lord does not accept even one of fifty-six food offerings or thirty-six curries offered without Tulasī leaves.

śiva-śuka-nārada, āur brahmādiko,
ḍhuḍata phirata mahā-muni jñānī
chandraśekhara māiyā, terā jaśa gāoye
bhakati-dāna dījiye mahārāṇi

(6) Lord Shiva, Śukadeva Goswāmī, Nārada Muni, all the demigods headed by Lord Brahmā, the mystics and great munis are all circumambulating you. O Tulasī Mahārāṇī, thus Chandraśekhara sings of your glories. Please bestow upon him the gift of devotion.
