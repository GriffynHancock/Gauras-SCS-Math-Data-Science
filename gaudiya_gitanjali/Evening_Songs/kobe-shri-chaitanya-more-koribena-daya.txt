Dainya Prārthanā Gīti

kobe śrī chaitanya more-koribena dayā
kobe āmi pāibo vaiṣṇava-pada-chāyā

(1) O when will Śrī Chaitanya bestow upon me his Grace? When will I get shelter in the shade of the holy feet of the Vaiṣṇavas?

kobe āmi chāḍibo e viṣoyābhimān
kobe viṣṇu-jane āmi koribo sammān

(2) When will I give up the false ego of being an enjoyer and when will I offer all respects to the sincere devotees of Lord Viṣṇu?

galavastra kṛtāñjali vaiṣṇava-nikaṭe
dante tṛṇa kori dā̐ḍāibo niṣkapaṭe

(3) When will I submit myself by the feet of the Vaiṣṇava with the cloth of surrender around my neck and with straw between my teeth?

kā̐diyā kā̐diyā jānāibo duḥkhagrām
saṁsāra-anala hoite māgibo viśrām

(4) Weeping and weeping when will I submit my sorrowful tale at the feet of the Vaiṣṇava and when will I seek relief from the fire of material suffering praying to that Vaiṣṇava for shelter and rest?

śuniyā āmāra duḥkha vaiṣṇava ṭhākura
āmā’ lāgi’ kṛṣṇe āvedibena prachura

(5) Upon hearing the tale of my worldly sorrow that saintly Vaiṣṇava will petition Krishna on my behalf in prayer.

vaiṣṇavera āvedane kṛṣṇa dayāmoy
e heno pāmara prati hoben sadoy

(6) Then satisfied by that Vaiṣṇava’s prayer Krishna will be merciful upon this wicked and sinful wretch.

vinodera nivedan vaiṣṇava-charaṇe
kṛpā kori saṅge loho ei akiñchane

(7) Bhakti Vinod Ṭhākur submits this prayer at the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas. “Give me your Grace and accept this lowly soul in your association.”
