Emona Gaurāṅga bine nāhi āra

emona gaurāṅga bine nāhi āra
heno avatāra    hobe ki hoyeche
heno prema parachāra

(1) No one is like Lord Gaurāṅga! Will there ever be an incarnation like Him, an incarnation that preached ecstatic love of Godhead as He did?

duramati ati    patita pāṣaṇḍī
prāṇe nā mārilo kore
harināma diye    hṛdoya śodhilo
jachi giyā ghore ghore

(2) He did not kill the fallen wicked-hearted blasphemers. Instead He went from house to house visiting them. He begged them to chant Lord Krishna’s Holy Names. He gave them the Holy Names and purified their hearts.

bhava biriñchira    vāñchito je prema
jagata phelilo ḍhāli
kāṅgāle pāiyā    khā-ilo nāchiye
bājāiye karatāli

(3) To the world He freely gave the rare gift of ecstatic love of Godhead, a gift even Brahmā and Shiva attain only with great difficulty. Attaining that gift, the poor people of this world danced and clapped their hands.

hāsiye kā̐diye    preme gaḍāgaḍi
pulake byāpilo aṅga
chaṇḍāle brāhmaṇe    kore kolākuli
kobe bā chilo e raṅga

(4) They laughed and wept. Overcome with ecstasy, they rolled on the ground. The hairs of their bodies stood erect. The brāhmaṇs and chaṇḍāls embraced. There was great bliss.

ḍākiye hā̐kiye    khol karatāle
gāiye dhāiye phire
dekhiyā śamana    tarāsa pāiye
kapāṭa hānilo dvāre

(5) Loudly they called out the Holy Names playing the mṛdaṅga and karatāls. They sang, ran, and danced in a circle. Seeing all this, peaceful composure became afraid, fled, and knocked on people’s doors.

e tina bhuvana    ānande bhorilo
uṭhilo maṅgala sora
kohe premānanda    emona gaurāṅga
rati nā janmilo mora

(6) An auspicious tumult arose. The three worlds were filled with bliss. Premānanda says: “Alas! Attachment for Lord Gaurāṅga did not arise in me.”
