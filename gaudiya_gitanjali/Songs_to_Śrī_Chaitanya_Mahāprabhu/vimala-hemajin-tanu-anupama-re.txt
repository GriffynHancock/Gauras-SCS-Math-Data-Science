Vimala hemajini

vimala hemajin    tanu anupama re!
tāhe śobhe nānā phuladāma
kadamba keśara    jini ektī pulaka re!
tāra mājhe bindu bindu ghāma

(1) His peerless form defeats the purest gold. His form is decorated with a garland of many kinds of flowers. His form is covered with hairs standing erect, hairs that defeat the filaments of kadamba flowers. His form is covered with drop after drop of perspirations.

jini’ madamatta hāti    gamana manthara ati
bhāvāveśe ḍhuli ḍhuli jāya
aruṇa-vasana chhobi    jini prabhātera robi
gorā-aṅge laharī khelāya

(2) His slow walking defeats the walking of intoxicated elephants. Overcome with ecstatic love, He staggers and staggers as He walks. His saffron garments defeat the beautiful colour of the rising sun. His fair limbs play in the waves of spiritual pastimes.

chalite nā pāre gorā-    chā̐d go̐sāi re
bolite nā pāre ādha-bola
bhāvete āveśa hoiyā    hari hari bolāiyā
āchaṇḍāle dhari’ deya kola

(3) Overcome, Lord Gauracandra has no power to walk. Now He has no power to speak. Half words are all He speaks. Overcome with ecstatic love, He chants, “Hari! Hari!” Everyone, even the lowest outcaste, He embraces in His arms.

e sukha-sampada-kāle    gorā nā bhajinu hele
heno pade nā korinu āśa
śrī-kṛṣṇa-chaitanya-chandra ṭhākura śrī-nityānanda
guṇa gāya vṛndāvana dāsa

(4) Alas! At that blissful fortunate time I did not worship Lord Gaura. I did not yearn to attain His feet. In this way Vṛndāvan das sings the glories of Lord Caitanyachandra and Lord Nityānanda.
