Kali-ghora timire

Kali-ghora timire

kali-ghora timire    garasala jagajana
dharama karama bahu-dūra
asādhane chintāmaṇi    vidhi milāola āni
gorā boḍo dayāla ṭhākura

(1) The people of this world have now been devoured by the dense darkness of this age of Kali and all good activities have gone far away. Thus they are apathetic to the transcendental gems offered by the greatly merciful Lord Gaura.

bhāi re bhāi!    gorā guṇa kohone nā jāya
koto śata-ānana    koto chatur-ānana
boroṇiyā ora nāhi pāya

(2) “O my brother! O my brother! No one has told you the glories of Lord Gaura. How great is Lord Brahmā? How great is Lord Śeṣa? They cannot eclipse the greatness of Lord Gaura.

chāri veda ṣaḍ-dara-    śana kori adhyayana
se jadi gaurāṅga nāhi bhaje
vṛthā tāra adhyayana    lochana vihīna jana
darpaṇe andhe kibā kāje

(3) “What use are the four Vedas and the six systems of philosophy if one does not worship Lord Gaurāṅga? Why study them? What use is a mirror to a blind man?

veda vidyā dui    kichui nā jānata
se jadi gaurāṅga jāne sāra
nayanānanda bhone    sei to sakali jāne
sarva-siddhi karatale tāra

(4) “If one knows the two kinds of Vedic knowledge, he still does not know anything. But if one knows Lord Gaurāṅga, he knows the most precious knowledge. Nayanānanda says: Such a person knows everything. All perfections stay in the palm of his hand.”
