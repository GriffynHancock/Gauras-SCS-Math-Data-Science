Ke jabi ke jabi

ke jabi ke jabi bhāi bhava-sindhu pāra
dhanya kali-yuge re chaitanya avatāra

(1) Who will go, oh brother, who will go to cross the ocean of material existence? The wealth and great fortune of this age of Kali is the incarnation of Lord Chaitanya.

āmāra gaurāṅgera ghāṭe ujānakheyā boy
kaḍipāti nāhi lāge amani pāra hoy

(2) My Lord Gaurāṅga stands at the jetty ready to ferry his servants upstream across this material existence. For no charge he is immediately taking them.

harināmera tarīkhāni śrī-guru-kāṇḍārī
saṅkīrtana-keroyāla du’bahu pasāri

(3) The ferry-boat is the Holy Names of the Lord and the spiritual master is the captain. The oars are the outstretched arms in the saṅkīrtan.

sarva-jīva uddhāra hoilo premera bātāse
lochana paḍiyā roilo karamera doṣe

(4) The favourable wind is divine love for Lord Krishna and all the fallen souls have been rescued on this boat. Only Lochan Dās is left behind due to the faults of his own misdeeds.
