Gaurā Pahu̐

gaurā pahu̐ nā bhajiyā mainu
prema ratana-dhana helāya hārāinu

(1) O Lord Gaura! I have not worshiped You and have been robbed of the jewel of divine love by my own negligence.

adhane jatana kori dhana teyā-ginu
āpana karama doṣe āpani ḍuvinu

(2) Although I am in need of Your wealth, I have endeavoured to reject Your riches and instead I have dived into sinful material activity.

sat-saṅga chāḍi koinu asate vilāsa
te-kāraṇe lāgilo je karma-bandha-phāṅsa

(3) Avoiding the association of saintly persons, I have enjoyed sporting with materialistic people. For that reason I have become bound in the noose of fruitive activity and its reactions.

viṣoya-biṣama-biṣa satata khāinu
gaura-kīrtana rase magana nā hoinu

(4) I have perpetually drunk the horrible poison of material sense gratification and have never become absorbed in the sweet nectar of the chanting of Lord Gaura’s Names.

keno bā āchaye prāṇa ki sukha lāgiyā
narottama dāsa keno nā gelo moriyā

(5) O why has my heart not experienced any satisfaction and why has Narottam Dās not simply perished?
