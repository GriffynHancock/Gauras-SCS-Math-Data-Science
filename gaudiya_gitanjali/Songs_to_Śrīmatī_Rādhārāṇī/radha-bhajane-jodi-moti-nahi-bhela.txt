Śrī Rādhāṣṭaka 3
----------------

Śrī Rādhāṣṭaka

rādhā-bhajane jodi moti nāhi bhelā
kṛṣṇa-bhajana tava akāraṇe gelā

(1) If one does not develop within his heart the desire for Rādhā-bhajan, then his Krishna-bhajan goes for nothing.

ātapa-rohita sūray nāhi jāni
rādhā-birahita mādhav nāhi māni

(2) Without sunlight the sun cannot be seen, similarly I don’t pay any mind to Krishna without Rādhā.

kevala mādhav pūjaye so ajñānī
rādhā anādara karai abhimānī

(3) One who worships Krishna alone is ignorant. Who does not adore Śrī Rādhā is an egotist.

kobohi nāhi karabi tā̐kor saṅga
chitte ichāsi jadi vraja-rasa-raṅga

(4) Never keep company with those who envy Rādhā if within your heart you at all aspire to the loving Pastimes of Vraja.

rādhikā-dāsī jodi hoy abhimān
śīghrai milai tava gokula kān

(5) Those who consider themselves maidservants of Śrī Rādhā will quickly meet Gokul-Krishna.

brahmā, śiva, nārada, śruti, nārāyaṇī
rādhikā-pada-raja pūjaye māni

(6) Brahmā, Shiva, Nārada, the śrutis, and Nārāyaṇī (Lakṣmī) worship with regard the holy feet of Śrī Rādhā.

umā, ramā, satyā, śachī, chandrā, rukmiṇī
rādhā-avatār sobe, —āmnāya-vāṇī

(7) Umā, Ramā, Satyā, Śachī, Chandrāvālī, and Rukminī are all personal expansions of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī — this is the self-evident verdict of the Vedas.

heno rādhā-paricharjyā jā̐kara dhana
bhakativinoda tā̐ra māgaye charaṇa

(8) Bhakti Vinod, whose only wealth is the service of Śrī Rādhā, humbly prays to be a serving maid at Her lotus feet.
