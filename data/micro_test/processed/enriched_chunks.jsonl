Appearing in this divine setting of pure Vaiṣṇava association, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj not only danced in the footsteps of the golden Lord Śrī Caitanya’s ongoing eternal saṅkīrtan party, but also synthesised the pure essence of all the previous saints’ realisations into increasingly ever sweeter and sweetest prose of praise. And if received with a drop of humility his realisations have the miraculous power to dissolve the hardest diamond heart into a condition of nectarean Divine Love. Indeed, Śrīla Guru Mahārāj once stated, “If you just once chanted the Name ‘Gaurāṅga’ purely you will melt, you won’t be able to maintain your form.” So if we can hear from the pure agent of Divinity submissively—without criticism and envy—those revelations we receive will change our hearts forever, and accordingly, to the degree of our śraddhā (faith), we will be personally transformed, so as to be able to actually live in those transcendental realisations.", "metadata": {"book_id": "en-AbsoluteHarmony", "title": "AbsoluteHarmony", "author": "Unknown", "chunk_index": 23, "type": "prose", "category": "biography", "source": "en-AbsoluteHarmony.txt", "tradition": "Gaudiya Vaishnavism", "has_sloka": false, "scripture_source": null, "entities": ["Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj", "Lord Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu", "Śrī Caitanya", "Nabadwīp"], "chronology": {"personal": true, "place": true}, "is_lila": false, "summary": "Śrīla Bhakti Rakṣak Śrīdhar Dev-Goswāmī Mahārāj was a spiritual leader who synthesized the realizations of previous saints and shared them through his writings."}}

Relation is the connection between two or more objects, whereas there is no lien of introduction of relation of one Integer.

Only as a third person are relations between two other seeable objects traced. Sometimes relations are not truly conceived by the observer through his differenced senses from the particular species of community. When the majority of the members differ from the particular view of one of them, they brand such affairs as an outcome of vitiation and error. At this time we observe the different predilective moods of different observers. This has given rise to contending solutions of relative observations.

This sort of owning or temporarily possessing can have a pacified position which may cease in the worker if he is enforced as stuporous.\n\nThe mind is the conductor of the senses. The senses get their field of work in limited objects of phenomena.
