# RAG Query: What is Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math?

## Answer
 The Śrī Chaitanya Sāraswat Maṭh is a spiritual organization established by Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj on the banks of the sacred Ganges in Nabadwīp Dhām, the holy land of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu. It is rooted in the teachings of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu and emphasizes service to Śrī Guru and Śrī Gaurāṅga, with activities that externally resemble material ones (like eating, sleeping, singing, dancing) but internally serve as devotional service. The Maṭh is guided by a succession of Āchāryas, beginning with Śrīla Śrīdhar Mahārāj, followed by Śrīla Govinda Mahārāj, and currently led by Śrīla Bhakti Nirmal Āchārya Mahārāj. Its spiritual purpose is to serve the servants of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and to fulfill the vision of Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu by cultivating a deep, personal love for the Divine through the practice of bhakti. The organization's activities are grounded in the conception that all devotees are eternal servants of the servants of the servants of Reality the Beautiful Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the ultimate goal is to serve Śrī Guru and Śrī Gaurāṅga, which leads to the service of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in Vraja Dhām. The Maṭh also maintains a strong tradition of devotional literature, including original compositions and commentaries on key texts such as Bhagavad-gītā and Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu. The Maṭh is also known for its emphasis on humility, tolerance, love, and affection in the service of the Lord. Additionally, it has a historical connection with a significant donation from Jagabandhu Prabhu, which helped establish its Kolkata headquarters. The Maṭh continues to grow and develop worldwide, with branches led by Āchāryas from various countries. The organization's core teachings are based on the concept that all service is meant to supply enjoyment to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and that the true path to spiritual realization is through devotion to Śrī Guru and Śrī Gaurāṅ
