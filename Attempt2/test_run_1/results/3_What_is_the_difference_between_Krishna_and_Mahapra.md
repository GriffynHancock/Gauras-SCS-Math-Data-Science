# RAG Query: What is the difference between Krishna and Mahaprabhu?

## Answer
 According to Srila B.R. Sridhar Maharaj, the difference between Krishna and Mahaprabhu lies in their modes of distributing spiritual mercy. While Krishna, in His original form, personally enjoys the mādhurya-līlā (pastimes of sweetness) with the gopīs and does not distribute entrance into these pastimes to jīva-souls, Mahāprabhu, in His audārya-līlā (pastimes of magnanimity), actively and freely distributes Kṛṣṇa’s mādhurya-līlā to all jīva-souls. This distribution of mercy is so extensive that it is considered more merciful than Krishna’s own līlā. Mahāprabhu is seen as Kṛṣṇa Himself appearing in the form of His devotee, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, allowing the full distribution of Kṛṣṇa-prema to the conditioned souls. As such, Mahāprabhu is described as the supreme giver of Kṛṣṇa-prema and is considered more merciful than Kṛṣṇa because of His ability to give Himself and His mercy to all. This is expressed in the verse: "No one is more merciful, or has ever given more, than Śrī Chaitanya Mahāprabhu, who appeared to distribute Kṛṣṇa-prema to everyone." Additionally, only through Mahāprabhu’s audārya-līlā can one enter Kṛṣṇa’s mādhurya-līlā, which is considered rare and exclusive. Thus, although Krishna is supreme in His original form, Mahāprabhu is the supreme distributor of Krishna’s spiritual pastimes and prema to the world. Srila B.R. Sridhar Maharaj emphasizes that Mahāprabhu is not just a form of Krishna but a unique and superior manifestation in the context of distributing Kṛṣṇa-prema to all souls. This distinction is highlighted by the fact that only Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, with ‘all rights reserved’ over Kṛṣṇa, can fully distribute Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa-prema, and when Kṛṣṇa appears as Mahāprabhu with the heart and halo of His supreme devotee, Rādhārāṇī, He becomes
