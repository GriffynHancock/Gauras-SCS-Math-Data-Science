1. Install:

pip install "unstructured[pdf]"
Also install system dependencies: tesseract-ocr, tesseract-lang (for full language/diacritics support), poppler-utils, and libmagic-dev.

2. Process locally with partition_pdf:

from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

elements = partition_pdf(
    filename="path/to/your-vaishnava-text.pdf",
    strategy="hi_res",       # best for layout + diacritics accuracy
    languages=["eng"]        # Tesseract English handles Latin diacritics (ā, ī, ś, ṇ, etc.)
)
Key points from the docs:

If url=None (the default), partition_pdf runs entirely locally — no API key needed.
The hi_res strategy uses local document layout analysis (detectron2_onnx) + Tesseract OCR. OCR is only applied if text isn't already extractable from the PDF.
Since many of your PDFs likely have embedded text (not scanned images), the fast strategy may also work and is ~100x faster. Try fast first on a sample — if diacritics come through correctly, use that. Fall back to hi_res for scanned/image-based PDFs.
You can also set the OCR agent via the OCR_AGENT environment variable (Tesseract is default; PaddleOCR is also supported).
3. For batch processing with chunking (RAG-ready):

Use the Ingest Python library with partition_by_api=False (or simply omit it):

from unstructured_ingest.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline
from unstructured_ingest.interfaces import ProcessorConfig
from unstructured_ingest.processes.connectors.local import *
from unstructured_ingest.processes.partitioner import PartitionerConfig
from unstructured_ingest.processes.chunker import ChunkerConfig

Pipeline.from_configs(
    context=ProcessorConfig(),
    indexer_config=LocalIndexerConfig(input_path="./your-pdfs/"),
    downloader_config=LocalDownloaderConfig(),
    source_connection_config=LocalConnectionConfig(),
    partitioner_config=PartitionerConfig(
        strategy="hi_res",
        # No partition_by_api, no api_key needed!
    ),
    chunker_config=ChunkerConfig(chunking_strategy="by_title"),
    uploader_config=LocalUploaderConfig(output_dir="./output/")
).run()
This processes everything on your machine with no cost. The output JSON is ready for embedding and loading into a vector store for RAG.
