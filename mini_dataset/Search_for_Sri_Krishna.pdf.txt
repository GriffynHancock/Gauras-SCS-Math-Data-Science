Nineteenth Century Founder of the Krishna
Consciousness Movement
'
We love to read a book which we have never read
before. We are anxious to gather whatever infor-
mation is contained in it, and with such acquirementour curiosity stops. This mode of study prevails amongst
11“Party spirit—that great enemy of truth—will always baffle the
attempt of the inquirer who tries to gather truth from the religiousworks of his nation and will make him believe that the AbsoluteTruth is nowhere except in his old religious book.”
ßrÈla Bhaktivinoda †hÅkur
a great number of readers who are great men in their
own estimation as well as in the estimation of those whoare of their own stamp. In fact, most readers are mere re-positories of facts and statements made by other people.But this is not study. The student is to read the factswith a view to create, and not with the object of fruit-less retention. Students, like satellites, should reflectwhatever light they receive from authors, and notimprison the facts and thoughts just as the magistratesimprison the convicts in the jail!
Thought is progressive. The author’s thought must
have progress in the reader in the shape of correction ordevelopment. He is the best critic who can show thefurther development of an old thought; but a mere de-nouncer is the enemy of progress, and consequently ofnature. Progress certainly is the law of nature, andthere must be corrections and developments with theprogress of time. But progress means going further or ris-ing higher. The shallow critic and the fruitless reader arethe two great enemies of progress. We must shun them.
The true critic, on the other hand, advises us to
preserve what we have already obtained, and to adjustour race from that point where we have arrived in theheat of our progress. He will never advise us to go backto the point whence we started, as he fully knows thatin that case there will be a fruitless loss of our valuabletime and labor. He will direct the adjustment of theangle of our race at the point where we are.12 T HESEARCH FOR SRIKRISHNAThis is also the characteristic of the useful student.
He will read an old author and will find out his exactposition in the progress of thought. He will never pro-pose to burn a book on the ground that it containsthoughts which are useless. No thought is useless.Thoughts are means by which we attain our objects.The reader who denounces a bad thought does notknow that a bad road is even capable of improvementand conversion into a good one. One thought is a roadleading to another. Thus, the reader will find that onethought, which is the object today, will be the means ofa further object tomorrow. Thoughts will necessarilycontinue to be an endless series of means and objects inthe progress of humanity.
The great reformers will always assert that they have
come out not to destroy the old law, but to fulfill it.
Valmiki, VyÅsa, Plato, Jesus, Mohammed, Confucius,and Chaitanya MahÅprabhu assert the fact eitherexpressly or by their conduct.
Our critic, however, may nobly tell us that a reformer
like VyÅsa, unless purely explained, may lead thou-sands of men into great trouble in time to come. Butdear critic! Study the history of ages and countries!
Where have you found the philosopher and reformerfully understood by the people? The popular religionis fear of God, and not the pure spiritual love whichPlato, VyÅsa, Jesus, and Chaitanya taught to their respec-tive peoples! Whether you give the absolute religionFOREWORD 13in figures or simple expressions, or teach them by means
of books or oral speeches, the ignorant and the thought-less must degrade it.
It is indeed very easy to tell, and swift to hear, that
Absolute Truth has such an affinity with the humansoul that it comes through as if intuitively, and thatno exertion is necessary to teach the precepts of truereligion, but this is a deceptive idea. It may be true ofethics and of the alphabet of religion, but not of thehighest form of faith, which requires an exalted soul tounderstand. All higher truths, though intuitive, requireprevious education in the simpler ones. That religion isthe purest which gives us the purest idea of God. Howthen is it possible that the ignorant will ever obtainthe absolute religion, as long as they are ignorant?
So we are not to scandalize the Savior of Jerusalem
or the Savior of Nadia for these subsequent evils.Luthers, instead of critics, are what we want for thecorrection of those evils by the true interpretation of theoriginal precepts.
God gives us truth as He gave it to VyÅsa, when
we earnestly seek for it. Truth is eternal and inex-haustable. The soul receives a revelation when it isanxious for it. The souls of the great thinkers of thebygone ages, who now live spiritually, often approachour inquiring spirit and assist it in its development.Thus, VyÅsa was assisted by NÅrada and BrahmÅ. Our14 T HESEARCH FOR SRIKRISHNAÍÅstras , or in other words, books of thought, do not
contain all that we could get from the infinite Father.No book is without its errors. God’s revelation isAbsolute Truth, but it is scarcely received and pre-served in its natural purity. We have been advised inthe ßrÈmad-BhÅgavatam (11.14.3) to believe that truth
when revealed is absolute, but it gets the tincture of thenature of the receiver in course of time, and is con-verted into error by continual exchange of hands fromage to age. New revelations, therefore, are continu-ally necessary in order to keep truth in its originalpurity. We are thus warned to be careful in our studiesof old authors, however wise they are reputed to be.Here, we have full liberty to reject the wrong idea,which is not sanctioned by the peace of conscience.
VyÅsa was not satisfied with what he collected in the
Vedas, arranged in the PurÅˆas, and composed in the
MahÅbhÅrata. The peace of his conscience did not sanc-
tion his labors. It told him from inside, “No, VyÅsa!You can’t rest contented with the erroneous picture oftruth which was necessarily presented to you by thesages of bygone days! You must yourself knock at thedoor of the inexhaustible store of truth from whichthe former sages drew their wealth. Go! Go up to thefountainhead of truth, where no pilgrim meets withdisappointment of any kind. VyÅsa did it and obtainedwhat he wanted. We have all been advised to do so.FOREWORD 15Liberty then, is the principle which we must consider
as the most valuable gift of God. We must not allowourselves to be led by those who lived and thoughtbefore us. We must think for ourselves and try to get fur-ther truths, which are still undiscovered. In the ßrÈmad
BhÅgavatam (11.21.23) we have been advised to take
the spirit of the ÍÅstras , and not the words. The
BhÅgavata is therefore a religion of liberty, unmixed
truth, and absolute love.
The other characteristic is progress. Liberty cer-
tainly is the father of all progress. Holy liberty is thecause of progress upwards and upwards in eternity andendless activity of love. Liberty misused causes degra-dation, and the Vai›ˆava must always carefully use this
high and beautiful gift of God.
The spirit of this text goes far to honor all great re-
formers and teachers who lived and will live in othercountries. The Vai›ˆava is ready to honor all men with-
out distinction of caste, because they are filled withthe energy of God. See how universal is the religion ofthe BhÅgavata. It is not intended for a certain class of
Hindus alone, but it is a gift to man at large, in what-ever country he is born, and in whatever society he isbred. In short, Vai›ˆavism is the Absolute Love binding
all men together into the infinite unconditioned andabsolute God. May peace reign forever in the wholeuniverse in the continual development of its purity by16 T HESEARCH FOR SRIKRISHNAthe exertion of the future heroes, who will be blessed
according to the promise of the BhÅgavata with powers
from the Almighty Father, the Creator, Preserver, andthe Annihilator of all things in Heaven and Earth.

sharing the vyÅsÅsana, the seat of VyÅsa offered to the bona fide
spiritual master. [ßrÈla Govinda MahÅrÅj (near the microphone)is speaking.]by
ßrÈla Bhaktivedanta SwÅmÈ PrabhupÅd
Founder-åchÅrya of the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness
We are very fortunate to hear His Divine Grace,
Om Vi›ˆupÅda Paramaha˜sa Parivrajak åchÅrya
Bhakti Rak›ak ßrÈdhar MahÅrÅj. By age and by experi-ence, in both ways, he is senior to me. I was fortunate tohave his association since a long time, since perhaps1930. At that time he had not accepted sannyÅs, but had
just left home. He went to preach in Allahabad, and onthat auspicious occasion we were connected.
ßrÈdhar MahÅrÅj lived in my house for many years, so
naturally we had very intimate talks. He has such highrealizations of Krishna that one would faint to hearthem. He was always my good advisor, and I took hisadvice very seriously because from the very beginning Iknew that he was a pure devotee of Krishna. So, Iwanted to associate with him. Krishna and PrabhupÅd,ßrÈla BhaktisiddhÅnta Saraswati †hÅkur, liked him toprepare me. Our relationship is very intimate.
After the breakdown of our spiritual master’s institu-
tion I wanted to organize another institution making
19PREFACEßrÈdhar MahÅrÅj the head. ßrÈla BhaktisiddhÅnta
Saraswati †hÅkur told me that ßrÈdhar MahÅrÅj is oneof the finest preachers of Krishna consciousness in theworld, so I wanted to take him everywhere. This was myearnest desire. But since he could not go around theworld and preach, at least the people of the worldshould come to hear from him.
For spiritual advancement of life we must go to
someone who is actually practicing spiritual life. So ifone is actually serious to take instructions from a Íik›a
guru, or instructing spiritual master, I can refer him to
one who is the most competent of all my Godbrothers.This is B.R. ßrÈdhar MahÅrÅj. I consider ßrÈdharMahÅrÅj to be even my Íik›a guru , so what to speak of
the benefit that others can have from his association.20 T HESEARCH FOR SRIKRISHNAEveryone is searching for rasa, pleasure. The status of
rasa is the highest. As persons we have our subjec-
tive existence, but rasa, pleasure, has His supersubjec-
tive existence. He is a person. He is akhila rasÅmÂta-
mËrtiÓ : the reservoir of all pleasure. He is Krishna. Rasa
is Krishna. There cannot be rasa in any other place
but Krishna. He is the fountainhead of all differenttypes of rasa. So, by the nature of our constitution we
have to search after Krishna.
In the Brahma-sËtra it is said, “Inquire after the
supreme cause of this world. Search!” From where haseverything come? How is everything maintaining its ex-istence? By whom? And ultimately, where does every-thing enter after death? That is brahma, spirit, the most
fundamental plane from where everything springs up,remains, and ultimately enters.
Where is brahma ? The Brahma-sËtra advises us to
inquire after the prime cause, the biggest, the all-accom-modating. But ßrÈ Chaitanya MahÅprabhu replacedthat, ßrÈmad-BhÅgavatam replaced that with KÂ›ˆÅnusan-
dhÅna : the search for ßrÈ Krishna.
BrahmÅ-jijñÅsÅ , the search for spirit, is a dry thing.
That is only the exercise of your thinking faculty, ajugglery of reason. Leave that behind. Begin the search
21INTRODUCTIONfor ßrÈ Krishna and quench the thirst of your heart.
Rasa jijñÅsÅ, raso vai saÓ . The things acquired by your
reason won’t satisfy you. JñÅna , knowledge, cannot
really quench your thirst, so instead of brahma-jijñÅsÅ
accept KÂ›ˆÅnusandhÅna and begin the search for ßrÈ
Krishna.
Where is Krishna? Our real want will be satisfied only
by getting the service of Krishna; not by anything else. Wewant to satisfy the innermost demands of our hearts. Wedon’t care to know where we are or what is controllingeverything, but we really want to quench our thirst forrasa, for mÅdhurya, for sweetness. We must search neither
for knowledge nor for the controller of this world; wemust search after rasa,Ånandam , after beauty and charm.
ßrÈ Chaitanya MahÅprabhu and ßrÈmad-BhÅgavatam
have taught us what to beg for, what to pray for, whatto want. They have taught us, “If you beg, beg forKrishna, not for anything else.” So, the fate of theVai›ˆavas , the students of the BhÅgavata and the fol-
lowers of MahÅprabhu, is sealed in the search for ßrÈKrishna. We want nothing else but Krishna.
The Vedas say, sÂˆvantu viÍve amÂtasya putrÅÓ : “O,
you sons of nectar, sons of the nectarine ocean sea:please listen to me. You were born in nectar; you wereborn to taste nectar, and you must not allow yourselvesto be satisfied by anything but nectar. So, however mis-guided you may be for the time being, awake! Arise!Search for that nectar, that satisfaction.” The Vedas tell22 T HESEARCH FOR SRIKRISHNAus, “O˜!”O˜means a big “Yes!” “What you are search-
ing for, that is! Don’t be disappointed.” The Vedas say
that the object of our inner search exists. The com-mon search of all your hearts is existing, and your thirst
will be quenched. By your constitution you are meant for
that and you deserve that, so don’t be afraid; don’t becowed down. It is already given in your being. And youcan never be satisfied with anything else. So prepareyourself, after your long search, to receive that longmissing nectar in its full form and quality. Awake! Arise!Search for your fortune and you cannot but have that.It is your birthright. It is the wealth of your own soul. Itcannot but be within you. You have no other business,no other engagement but KÂ›ˆÅnusandhÅna, the Search
for ßrÈ Krishna: Reality the Beautiful.INTRODUCTION 23At the beginning of the twentieth century, the
Bengali poet Hemachandra wrote, “There are so
many countries rising in prominence: this land, thatland.  Japan is a very small country, but it is rising likethe sun. Only India is under eternal slumber.” When hementioned the other part of the world, he said,“America is rising forcefully, as if he is coming to swal-low the whole world. Sometimes he is shouting as ifwith a war cry, and the whole world is shivering. Hisenthusiasm is so intense and great that he wants tosnatch the world from the solar system, and give it anew shape, a new molding.” America has been men-tioned in this way by Hemachandra. In the same way,Bhaktivedanta SwÅmÈ MahÅrÅj came to give the worlda new shape through Krishna consciousness. He oncesaid, “We must go there and build it in a new way—with Krishna consciousness.”
What is Krishna consciousness? Krishna consciousness
means real love and beauty. Real love and beauty mustpredominate; not selfishness, or exploitation. Generally,whenever we see beauty, we think that beauty is to be
25KRISHNA
CONSCIOUSNESS :
LOVE AND BEAUTYexploited, but actually, beauty is the exploiter, beauty is
the master, and beauty is the controlling principle.
And what is love? Love means sacrifice for others.
We should not think that sacrifice is to be exploited byus. Who is to be the recipient of sacrifice? Is it ourparty? No. We are in the group of those who sacrificethemselves: the predominated negative party,MahÅbhÅva’s party. The underlying principle of love issacrifice, but sacrifice for whom? And who is the ben-eficiary? Love is the beneficiary. Everyone should con-tribute to the center, but no one should draw energyfrom there. “Die to live.” With this spirit we shouldcombine and work for real love and beauty.
B
ANNER OF LOVE
And beauty will be victorious in the world. Love
will be victorious in the world. We will sacrifice every-thing to see that the banner of divine love will flutterall over the world, for a particle of that divine lovewill be able to keep peace and distribute peace in alldirections. Just as fighting soldiers dedicate everything,and give their lives so their countrymen will benefit inthe future, we should sacrifice our lives and work tobring real peace for everyone.
In VÂndÅvana, the land of Krishna, the standard of
sacrifice is unlimited. Devotees there are willing to riskeverything for Krishna. If that principle of sacrifice isenthroned, then peace will automatically follow.26 T HESEARCH FOR SRIKRISHNAKrishna consciousness should be enthroned above all
other conceptions. All other conceptions are meantto be subservient to Krishna consciousness. The ideal ofVÂndÅvana, Krishna’s abode, is above all other ideals. Intheistic comparison, the conception of ßrÈ ChaitanyaMahÅprabhu’s lÈlÅ is above all other conceptions. There,
theism reaches its zenith. That is our highest goal, andstep by step, that should be explained, thought out,accepted, and preached.
A
TOMIC DEATH
Without this, what sort of benefit are you expecting
from your present engagement? Only death is awaitingyou. You are so proud of this scientific civilization andare boasting so much, but death is awaiting you whetherit is atomic death or natural death. You can’t crossdeath. One English poet has written:
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gaveAwaits alike the inevitable hour:The paths of glory lead but to the grave
—Thomas Gray’s  Elegy in a Country Churchyard
You do not care to solve the greatest danger. You say
that you are big thinkers, that you are great men, andthat you should command the respect of society, but thegeneral inevitable problem for every atom here is death.What is your contribution for solving the greatest dan-ger which is waiting to devour everyone—scientist,KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS : LOVE AND BEAUTY 27insect, or virus? What is your solution to death? Have
you taken any steps to solve that universal danger?What you are doing at present is exploitation, and youare encouraging a lower life as a reaction. You areexploiting nature, and everyone who is deriving thebenefits will have to pay to the farthing with interest.
“For every action there is an equal and opposite
reaction.” This is your statement, but what have youdone to solve that? You are endangering the fate ofthe world by your fascinating proposals of apparentcomfort. What is this? You are avoiding the greatestinevitable danger, so your life is a useless malengage-ment. In one sense, you are traitors to society. Comewith courage to face and solve the real problem, thecommon problem, and the most dangerous problem;otherwise you should leave the field and go away. Leaveit to us. We shall prove that the world is an abode ofperfect happiness: (viÍva˜ pËrˆa sukhÅyate) .

IVEDEEP INTO REALITY
But to understand this, you will have to dive deep,
not into the plane of body and mind, but into theplane of soul. You will have to dive deep into the real-ity that is within us. It is not a foreign thing to beacquired by loan, but the soul is within everyone, eventhe insects and the trees. So, we have to rise to theplane of soul. Eliminate both your physical and mentalencasements and find out your own self. There you28 T HESEARCH FOR SRIKRISHNAwill find the key, the clue to the proper world where life
is worth living.
The solution is there; a hint is given by many mahÅ-
janas, by great saints in every religious sect to some
extent, but our claim is that India has given the high-est conception of the spiritual world in the Bhagavad-
gÈtÅ and ßrÈmad-BhÅgavatam . So, we challenge all of
you: we are not imaginationists; we are most practicalthinkers. We don’t avoid any great problem by saying,“Oh, it can’t be solved.” We do not belong to the partythat wants to easily take prestige and fame. We don’twant to classify ourselves with those hoaxing people.Come and see whether the plane of reality can be
