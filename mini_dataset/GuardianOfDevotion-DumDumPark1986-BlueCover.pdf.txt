GUARDIAN OF DEVOTION
The Appearance
Of Sri Gaurasundar
by Sripad Bhakti Sundar Govinda Maharaja
Within the sacred land of India, the holy foot-
prints of the Lord and His devotees are a place of
pilgrimage for the whole world. The seven auspici-
ous places in India which are said to award libera-
tion, are all found within those footprints. Among
those holy places is Sri Mayapur which is situated in
Sri Nabadwip Dham. It is non-different irom Mathura
mandal. Srila Vrindavana das Tahkur has written,
“There is no other village in the world like Sri
Nabadwip, where Lord Chaitanya Gosai has descen-
ded”. Truly Sri Nabadwip Dham is the best of all,
and there is no other place like it, since the most
magnanimous mercy-personified Sri Gaura_ Hari
appeared in this part of the world. He indiscriminantly
distributed to all persons, whether they were qualified
or unqualified, the highest perfection of love of God
which is difficult for even the demigods to obtain.
He has so generously distributed this highest gift
even to the most fallen. Therefore Sri Nabadwip is
incomparable in the world.
Center Of Learning
Nearly 500 years ago Sri Nabadwip city was
reknowned throughout the world as the center of
learning and knowledge. The science of logic which
was brought from Mithila, was cultured by the intelli-
gensia of Sri Nabadwip, and its fame was spread all
over the world. From Benares in Northern India, and
from many other places sannyasis and the class of
professors who were well read in Nyaya and Vedanta
all came to Nabadwip for learning. From Kanchi in
Southern India, and other places too, many students
desirous of becoming well educated, all came to Sri
Nabadwip. ‘‘Persons from different places all go to
Nabadwip, for one who studies in Nabadwip he gets
the taste for knowledge. No wonder there were
hundreds of thousands of students and professors
there”. (Chaitanya Bhagawat). Truly speaking
“Even a boy can argue with a Bhattacharya,” if he
studied at Nabadwip. Everyone considered himself
a great scholar if he studied there. And there was
No chance of getting recognition from the scholarly
community if one did not study or teach in Sri
Nabadwip.
Glories Of Sri Nabadwip
Nabadwip was noted for its opulences which,
by the grace of Sri Lakshmidevi, were shared by all
the people there. On one bank of the Ganges, the
greatest place of all learning, the most sacred Sri
Mayapur was situated. Many wealthy persons from
different parts of the world all came to settle there.
Srila Vrindavana das Thakur writes, “Who can des-
cribe the opulence of Sri Nabadwip? Thousands of
people go to take bath there, because Lakshmidevi
glances over that place. Everyone lives there in great
happiness, The Lord, knowing He would appear
there, had arranged everything very nicely for His
descent”. The whole atmosphere was surcharged
with auspiciousness, with many wealthy and learned
persons coming from distant places to reside there
in that holy place of pilgrimage and seat of learning.
There is no need in mentioning the glories associated
with such a place.
The Age Of Ritualism
But the pain within the hearts of the pure devo-
tees knew no bounds. In the midst of all this grandeur
and beauty they could see that everyone was
simply wasting their valuable time in  persuing
materialistic objectives. Seeing this how could they
be happy ? Everyone was simply mad for wealth, mad
for physical beauty, mad for acquiring followers, mad
for knowledge and intoxicated with the empiric specu-
