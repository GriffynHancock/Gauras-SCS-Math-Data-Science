Meditation on Sri G(tå—
O Bhagavad-G(tå, song of the Supreme Lord Himself,
You are the bestower of Arjuna’s enlightenment. You havebeen woven into the scripture Mahåbhårata by the ancient
sage Srila Vedavyåsa. In eighteen chapters, You are therain of ever-ﬂowing nectar, non-different from the Lord.O Mother, I meditate upon You; may You graciously entermy heart.
Obeisances unto Srila Vyåsadeva—
O Srila Vyåsadeva of formidable intelligence, whose eyes
resemble the long petals of the blooming lotus ﬂower,and who ignited the lamp of knowledge, ﬁlled with theoil of the Mahåbhårata —I offer my obeisances unto you.
Obeisances unto the Lord as the chariot-driver of
Arjuna—
I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Lord Sri K±!@a,
who fulﬁlls the wishes of His surrendered devotees. Heholds a driving-rod in one hand while the other is poisedin the expression of instruction, and He is the milker ofthe nectar of the G(tå.
The Glories of the G(tå—
The crest-jewels of the Vedas, all the Upani!ads, are as
the cow, and the milker of the cow is Lord Sri K±!@a, theson of Nanda Mahåråj. Arjuna is the calf, the nectar ofthe G(tå is the milk, and the fortunate devotees are the
enjoyers of that milk.
Obeisances unto Lord Sri K±!@a—
I bow unto the lotus feet of Sri K±!@a, the son of Vasudeva,
the vanquisher of the demons Ka^sa and Chå@)ra, thejoy of mother Devak(, and the universal teacher.A 02 Invocation  7/6/06 3:37 AM  Page 3Srimad Bhagavad-G(tå [4]
The river of the battle of Kuruk!etra—
One bank is Bh(!ma, the other Dro@åchårya; Jayadratha
is the water; the sons of Gåndhår(, the blue lotus ﬂower;Íalya, the crocodile; K~pa, the waves; Kar@a, the shore;Aßvatthåmå, Vikar@a and company, the fearful sharks;Duryodhana, the whirlpool; and Keßava is the boatmanof this river of the battle that was crossed by the På@#avas.
The Mahåbhårata as a lotus ﬂower—
These words of Sri K±!@a Dvaipåyana Vyåsadeva, the son
of Paråßara Muni, are a perfect lotus ﬂower. The mean-ing of the G(tå is the beautiful fragrance of this lotus, the
various episodes are its stamens, and the enlighteningnarrations about the Supreme Lord are its nectar. In thisworld, the pure devotees are the bees who day after daydelight in drinking the nectar of the lotus ﬂower. Maythis Mahåbhårata lotus, the vanquisher of all evils in this
age of Kali, graciously bestow auspiciousness upon us.
Obeisances unto the Supreme Lord—
I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Lord whose
glories are sung with celestial prayers by the gods Brahmå,Varu@a, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts; whose glories aresung by the verses of the Vedas along with their six
auxiliary books and the Upani!ads ; whose glories are sung
by the bråhma@as that sing the Såma-Veda ; who the yog(s
see within their hearts absorbed in meditation; and whoseinﬁnite glories are inconceivable to all beings, whether godsor demons.
Before reciting the scriptures that can conquer material
existence, we offer obeisances unto the Supreme Lord whois known as Nåråya@a, Nara and Narottama; the goddessof learning Saraswat(; and the great sage empowered bythe Lord to reveal the scriptures, Srila Vyåsadeva.A 02 Invocation  7/6/06 3:37 AM  Page 4[5]
Preface
[Publisher’s Note, ﬁrst Bengali Edition,
Appearance Day of Lord K±!@a, 1961]
Unique in its wide publication and extensive circulation,
the Srimad Bhagavad-gita appears in various languages,
both in India and other countries, along with the com-mentaries of former great saints as well as modernscholars. The commentaries of the prominent Vai!@ava•chåryas such as Sri Råmånuja, Srimat Madhvamuni, and
Sri Sridhar Swåm(påd are most noteable, whilst amongthe proponents of jåna-mårga, or the monistic path, the
commentaries of Srimat Ía&karåchårya and Sri Madhu-s)dan Saraswat( are well-known. The commentaries ofSriyuta Båla Ga&gådhar Tilak and Sri Aurobindo favourthe school of karma-yoga, or the path of action, and are
also familiar to modern scholars. Great thinkers of bothEast and West have ardently sung the glories of Sri G(tå,
being inspired by the ideals of its teachings.
However, the achintya-bhedåbheda-siddhånta, theology
of ‘inconceivable oneness and difference’ as revealed bythe proponents of Sri Chaitanya Mahåprabhu—Gau#(ya•chåryas Srila Vißvanåth Chakravart( and Srila Baladev
Vidyåbh)!a@a, is concluded by the learned devotees tobe most favorable to exclusive devotion. The devotees alsoembrace Srila Bhaktivinoda ¢håkur’s Bengali commentaryof Sri G(tå as a harmonious, spiritual mine of the treasure
of divine love for Sri K±!@a {K±!@a- prema}, the ﬁfth and
transcendental goal of life, beyond the four generalhuman objectives of religion, wealth, sense enjoymentand liberation.A 03preface&intro  7/6/06 3:43 AM  Page 5Srimad Bhagavad-G(tå [6]
In his introduction my worshipful Divine Master,
Sri Gurupådapadma O^ Vishnupada Paramaha^saParivråjakåchårya Sri Srimad Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswåm( Mahåråj, has revealed to the readersglimpses of his own deep devotional realizations. Althoughnumerous editions of Sri G(tå are presently available, few
commentaries can be said to nurture pure devotionaccording to the teachings of bona ﬁde divine succession,which has given us the opportunity of service in produc-ing this edition. We shall consider ourselves blessed if thefortunate readers take the all-auspicious essence of thissincere attempt to heart.

Bowing down to the holy feet of Sri Guru, Sri Gauranga,
and Sri Sri Rådhå Govindasundara, all accompanied byTheir associates, I sing the glories of the hidden treasureof Srimad Bhagavad-g(tå .
Since Srimad Bhagavad-g(tå is very familiar to the learned
society, an acquaintance of the conceptions of this editionmay be given here. We are followers of the school ofthought descending from Sri Chaitanya Mahåprabhu, sothis edition is based on the Sri G(tå commentaries of the
pre-eminent, exalted Sri Gau#(ya Vai!@ava •chåryas— Sri
Vißvanåth, Sri Baladev and Srila Bhaktivinoda ¢håkur.By the grace of our worshipful spiritual master, O^Vishnupada Srila Bhakti Siddhånta Saraswat( Goswåm(Prabhupåda, and from indications in the commentariesgiven by the aforementioned great pure devotees, inplaces some new light has been shed, revealing deepermeanings. The devoted reader will appreciate this partic-ularly with regard to the four verses {10.8–11} whichwere described by Sri Vißvanåthpåda as the four essen-tial verses { chatu%-ßlok( } of the book.
Generally, Sri G(tå is known as an excellent study of
the science of religion. The language of Sri G(tå is simpleA 03preface&intro  7/6/06 3:43 AM  Page 7Srimad Bhagavad-G(tå [8]
and sweet; its mood is grave, extensive and radical; its
thought is succinct, lucid and impartial; and its logic issound and natural. The eloquence of the prologue, epi-logue, exposition, review, analysis, synthesis and deliveryof Sri G(tå is unprecedented and charming in the
extreme. Sri G(tå is activation for the lazy, courage for
the fearful, hope for the hopeless, and new life for the dying. Sri G(tå uniﬁes and sustains all ranks, whether
revolutionary, occultist, optimist, renunciationist, libera-tionist, or full-ﬂedged theist. From the atheist of grosslycrude vision to the most elevated saint, the essentialconceptions of all classes of philosopher are illustratedwith clear and powerful logic. The devotees of the Lord{bhagavad-bhaktas } and persons on the paths of action,
knowledge and yoga{karm(s, jån(s and yog(s} will each
ﬁnd the essence of their paths dealt with in a compre-hensive and illuminating manner, and thus the book ishighly esteemed by all.
The essential and inner purport of the Vedas and
Upani!ads of the •ryans is directly explained, and the
essence of various non-•ryan doctrines can also be found.Sri G(tå teaches us enlightenment through the selﬂess
execution of scripturally ordained actions. When theconsciousness is thus puriﬁed, self-realization or spiritualrealization is attained. In its maturity, this pure realizationblossoms into loving service in the joyful, divine plane.
From the standpoint of sambandha-jåna or ‘knowledge
of relationship’, Sri G(tå gives us the conception that the
Absolute Reality is a transcendental personality; from thestandpoint of prayojana or ‘the objective’, spiritual love
for the Absolute Reality is given as the highest attain-ment; and from the standpoint of abhidheya or ‘theA 03preface&intro  7/6/06 3:43 AM  Page 8Introduction [9]
means’, we are taught that one must initially offer all his
actions to the Supreme Lord, followed by the cultivationof self-realization favourable to realization of the Lord,and ﬁnally surrender to the Lord, to the exclusion of allother endeavours. Ultimately, the means will culminatein the objective when, in one’s perfected spiritual form,one whole-heartedly engages in the transcendental lovingservice of the Lord.
Sri G(tå has clearly shown the distinctions between the
various paths, such as the path of action, including wor-ship of the gods for worldly fulﬁllment, and the path ofknowledge, for the attainment of liberation. The thought-ful reader can note that Sri G(tå, by its comparative
study, refutes the misconception that the many paths andgoals are ‘all one’. Rather, it is stated, yo yach chhradha%
sa eva sa%, “A man is known by his faith.”
These verses would warrant deep consideration in this
respect:
“The yog( is superior to persons engaged in austerities,
superior to the person of knowledge , and superior to the
person of action… Therefore, O Arjuna, be a yog(. And
best of all yog(sis My faithful devotee for whom I am the
only goal, and who serves Me whole-heartedly. This isMy opinion.” {6.46,47}
Showing the inferiority and meaninglessness of dry
renunciation, the gift of Sri G(tå is most substantial and
positive. Rather then merely renouncing action, oneshould selﬂessly offer one’s actions to the Supreme Lord{karma-yoga }. Ultimately, based on one’s surrender, one
will be inspired to act in devotion { bhakti} for the Lord
alone. This is the conclusive and sublime teaching of Sri
G(tå. In the ﬁnest conception, the overall excellence ofA 03preface&intro  7/6/06 3:43 AM  Page 9Srimad Bhagavad-G(tå [10]
Sri G(tå is found in its gift of devotion. In its full mani-
festation, such devotion is prema-bhakti, loving devotion
to the all-attractive Supreme Personality—Sri K±!@a,Reality the Beautiful.
Secret, more secret, and the most secret of all teachings
have been given, as the congregational chanting of the holynames of the Lord { sa&k(rtana }, and service in spontaneity
{bhåva-sevå }, with exclusive surrender and dedication to
the transcendental pleasure of K±!@a as the ultimate goalof life, as sung by the vibrant clarion call of Sri G(tå—
sarva-dharmån parityajya, måm eka^ ßara@a^ vraja, and
as deeply contemplated by the followers of the lotus foot-steps of the Supreme Lord who mercifully appears as thesaviour in this age of Kali—Sri Chaitanyachandra, and ascorroborated by the divine succession of saintly teachers.
May Lord Sri K±!@a accept the offering of this edition.
